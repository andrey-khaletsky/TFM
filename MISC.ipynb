It is comprised of two main sections.\\n\\nThe first section describes what GTFS is and provides details about the\\nspecification itself. In addition to this it also provides various\\ndiscussion points and things to consider for each of the files in the\\nspecification.\\n\\nThe second section covers a number of topics that relate to actually\\nusing GTFS feeds, such as how to calculate fares, how to search for\\ntrips, how to optimize feed data and more.\\n\\nThis book is written for developers that are using transit data for web\\nsites, mobile applications and more. It aims to be as language-agnostic\\nas possible, but uses SQL to demonstrate concepts of extracting data\\nfrom a GTFS feed.\\n\\n### About The Author\\n\\nQuentin Zervaas is a software developer from Adelaide, Australia.\\n\\nQuentin was the founder of TransitFeeds (now <OpenMobilityData.org>), a web\\nsite that provides a comprehensive listing of public transportation data\\navailable around the world. This site is referenced various times\\nthroughout this book.\\n\\n### Credits\\n\\nFirst Edition.

       " '## 1. Introduction to GTFS\\n\\nGTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) is a data standard developed\\nby Google used to describe a public transportation system. Its primary\\npurpose was to enable public transit agencies to upload their schedules\\nto Google Transit so that users of Google Maps could easily figure out\\nwhich bus, train, ferry or otherwise to catch.\\n\\n> **A GTFS feed is a ZIP file that contains a series of CSV files that\\nlist routes, stops and trips in a public transportation system.**\\n\\nThis book examines GTFS in detail, including which data from a public\\ntransportation system can be represented, how to extract data, and\\nexplores some more advanced techniques for optimizing and querying data.\\n\\nThe official GTFS specification has been referenced a number of times in\\nthis book. It is strongly recommended you are familiar with it. You can\\nview at the following URL:\\n\\n<https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference>\\n\\n### Structure of a GTFS Feed\\n\\nA GTFS feed is a series of CSV files, which means that it is trivial to\\ninclude additional files in a feed. Additionally, files required as part\\nof the specification can also include additional columns. For this\\nreason, feeds from different agencies generally include different levels\\nof detail.\\n\\n***Note:** The files in a GTFS feed are CSV files, but use a file\\nextension of `.txt`.*\\n\\nA GTFS feed can be described as follows:\\n\\n> **A GTFS feed has one or more routes. Each route (`routes.txt`) has one or\\nmore trips (`trips.txt`). Each trip visits a series of stops (`stops.txt`)\\nat specified times (`stop_times.txt`). Trips and stop times only contain\\ntime of day information; the calendar is used to determine on which days\\na given trip runs (`calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt`).**\\n\\nThe following chapters cover the main files that are included in all\\nGTFS feeds. For each file, the main columns are covered, as well as\\noptional columns that can be included. This book also covers some of the\\nunofficial columns that some agencies choose to include.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '## 2. Agencies (agency.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nThe `agency.txt` file is used to represent the agencies that provide\\ndata for this feed. While its presence is optional, if there are routes\\nfrom multiple agencies included, then records in `routes.txt` make\\nreference to agencies in this file.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :-------- |\\n| `agency_id`                                            | Optional | An ID that uniquely identifies a single transit agency in the feed. If a feed only contains routes for a single agency then this value is optional. |\\n| `agency_name`                                          | Required | The full name of the transit agency. |\\n| `agency_url`                                           | Required | The URL of the transit agency. Must be a complete URL only, beginning with `http://` or `https://`. |\\n| `agency_timezone`                                      | Required | Time zone of agency. All times in `stop_times.txt` use this time zone, unless overridden by its corresponding stop. All agencies in a single feed must use the same time zone. Example: **America/New_York** (See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones> for more examples) |\\n| `agency_lang`                                          | Required | Contains a two-letter ISO-639-1 code (such as `en` or `EN` for English) for the language used in this feed. |\\n| `agency_phone`                                         | Optional | A single voice telephone number for the agency that users can dial if required. |\\n| `agency_fare_url`                                      | Optional | A URL that describes fare information for the agency. Must be a complete URL only, beginning with `http://` or `https://`. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following extract is taken from the GTFS feed of TriMet (Portland,\\nUSA), located at <https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>.\\n\\n| `agency_name` | `agency_url`                                 | `agency_timezone`     | `agency_lang` | `agency_phone`   |\\n| :------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------ | :--------------- |\\n| `TriMet`      | `[https://trimets.org](https://trimet.org/)` | `America/Los_Angeles` | `en`          | `(503) 238-7433` | \\n\\nIn this example, the `agency_id` column is included, but as there is\\nonly a single entry the value can be empty. This means the `agency_id`\\ncolumn in `routes.txt` also is not required.\\n\\n### Discussion\\n\\nThe data in this file is typically used to provide additional\\ninformation to users of your app or web site in case schedules derived\\nfrom the rest of this feed are not sufficient (or in the case of\\n`agency_fare_url`, an easy way to provide a reference point to users\\nif the fare information in the feed is not being used).\\n\\nIf you refer to the following screenshot, taken from Google Maps, you\\ncan see the information from `agency.txt` represented in the\\nlower-left corner as an example of how it can be used.\\n\\n![GTFS agency](images/agency-google-maps.png)\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '## 3. Stops & Stations (stops.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nThe individual locations where vehicles pick up or drop off passengers\\nare represented by `stops.txt`. Records in this file are referenced in\\n`stop_times.txt`. A record in this file can be either a stop or a\\nstation. A station has one or more child stops, as indicated using the\\n`parent_station` value. Entries that are marked as stations may not\\nappear in `stop_times.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `stop_id` | Required | An ID to uniquely identify a stop or station. |\\n| `stop_code` | Optional | A number or short string used to identify a stop to passengers. This is typically displayed at the physical stop or on printed schedules. |\\n| `stop_name` | Required | The name of the stop as passengers know it by. |\\n| `stop_desc` | Optional | A description of the stop. If provided, this should provide additional information to the `stop_name` value. |\\n| `stop_lat` | Required | The latitude of the stop (a number in the range of `-90` to `90`). |\\n| `stop_lon` | Required | The longitude of the stop (a number in the range of `-180` to `180`). |\\n| `zone_id` | Optional | This is an identifier used to calculate fares. A single zone ID may appear in multiple stops, but is ignored if the stop is marked as a station. |\\n| `stop_url` | Optional | A URL that provides information about this stop. It should be specific to this stop and not simply link to the agency\\'s web site. |\\n| `location_type` | Optional | Indicates if a record is a stop or station. `0` or blank means a stop, `1` means a station. |\\n| `parent_station` | Optional | If a record is marked as a stop and has a parent station, this contains the ID of the parent (the parent must have a `location_type` of `1`). |\\n| `stop_timezone` | Optional | If a stop is located in a different time zone to the one specified in `agency.txt`, then it can be overridden here. |\\n| `wheelchair_boarding` | Optional | A value of `1` indicates it is possible for passengers in wheelchairs to board or alight. A value of `2` means the stop is not wheelchair accessible, while `0` or an empty value means no information is available. If the stop has a parent station, then 0 or an empty value means to inherit from its parent. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following extract is taken from the TriMet GTFS feed\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `stop_id` |  `stop_code` |  `stop_name`        | `stop_lat`  | `stop_lon`    | `stop_url`                                          |\\n| :-------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :---------- | :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------|\\n| `2`       | `2`          | `A Ave & Chandler`  | `45.420595` | `-122.675676` |` <http://trimet.org/arrivals/tracker?locationID=2>` |\\n| `3`       | `3`          | `A Ave & Second St` | `45.419386` | `-122.665341` |` <http://trimet.org/arrivals/tracker?locationID=3>` |\\n| `4`       | `4`          | `A Ave & 10th St`   | `45.420703` | `-122.675152` |` <http://trimet.org/arrivals/tracker?locationID=4>` |\\n| `6`       | `6`          | `A Ave & 8th St`    | `45.420217` | `-122.67307`  |` <http://trimet.org/arrivals/tracker?locationID=6>` |\\n\\nThe following diagram shows how these points look if you plot them onto\\na map.\\n\\n![Stops](images/stops-sample.png)\\n\\nIn this extract, TriMet use the same value for stop IDs and stop codes.\\nThis is useful, because it means the stop IDs are stable (that is, they\\ndo not change between feed versions). This means that if you want to\\nsave a particular stop (for instance, if a user wants to save a\\n\"favorite stop\") you can trust that saving the ID will get the job done.\\n\\n**Note:** This is not always the case though, which means you may have\\nto save additional information if you want to save a stop. For instance,\\nyou may need to save the coordinates or the list of routes a stop serves\\nso you can find it again if the stop ID has changed in a future version\\nof the feed.\\n\\n### Stops & Stations\\n\\nSpecifying an entry in this file as a *station* is typically used when\\nthere are many stops located within a single physical entity, such as a\\ntrain station or bus depot. While many feeds do not offer this\\ninformation, some large train stations may have up to 20 or 30\\nplatforms.\\n\\nKnowing the platform for a specific trip is extremely useful, but if a\\npassenger wants to select a starting point for their trip, showing them\\na list of platforms may be confusing.\\n\\nPassenger:\\n\\n**\"I want to travel from *Central Station* to *Airport Station*.\"**\\n\\nWeb site / App:\\n\\n**\"Board at *Central Station platform 5*, disembark at *Airport Station platform 1*.\"**\\n\\nIn this example, the passenger selects the parent station, but they are\\npresented with the specific stop so they know exactly where within the\\nstation they need to embark or disembark.\\n\\n### Wheelchair Accessibility\\n\\nIf you are showing wheelchair accessibility information, it is important\\nto differentiate between \"no access\" and \"no information\", as knowing a\\nstop is not accessible is as important as knowing it is.\\n\\nIf a stop is marked as being wheelchair accessible, you must check that\\ntrips that visit the stop are also accessible (using the\\n`wheelchair_accessible` field in `trips.txt`). If the value in\\n`trips.txt` is blank, `0` or `1` then it is safe to assume the\\ntrip can be accessed. If the stop is accessible and the trip is not,\\nthen passengers in wheelchairs cannot use the trip.\\n\\n### Stop Features\\n\\nOne of the proposed changes to GTFS is the addition of a file called\\n`stop_features.txt`. This is used to define characteristics about\\nstops. The great thing about this file is that it allows you to indicate\\nto users when a stop has a ticket machine, bike storage, lighting, or an\\nelectronic display with real-time information.\\n\\nTriMet is one of the few agencies including this file.

Routes (routes.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nA route is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single\\nservice.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `route_id` | Required | An ID that uniquely identifies the route. |\\n| `agency_id` | Optional | The ID of the agency a route belongs to, as it appears in `agency.txt`. Only required if there are multiple agencies in the feed. |\\n| `route_short_name` | Required | A nickname or code to represent this service. If this is left empty then the `route_long_name` must be included. |\\n| `route_long_name` | Required | The route full name. If this is left empty then the `route_short_name` must be included. |\\n| `route_desc` | Optional | A description of the route, such as where and when the route operates. |\\n| `route_type` | Required | The type of transportation used on a route (such as bus, train or ferry). See below for more information. |\\n| `route_url` | Optional | A URL of a web page that describes this particular route. |\\n| `route_color` | Optional | If applicable, a route can have a color assigned to it. This is useful for systems that use colors to identify routes. This value is a six-character hexadecimal number (for example, `FF0000` is red). |\\n| `route_text_color` | Optional | For routes that specify the `route_color`, a corresponding text color should also be specified. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following extract is taken from the TriMet GTFS feed\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `route_id` | `route_short_name` | `route_long_name`            | `route_type` |\\n| :--------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------- |\\n| `1`        | `1`                | `Vermont`                    | `3`          |\\n| `4`        | `4`                | `Division / Fessenden`       | `3`          |\\n| `6`        | `6`                | `Martin Luther King Jr Blvd` | `3`          |\\n\\nThis sample shows three different bus routes for the greater Portland\\narea. The `route_type` value of `3` indicates they are buses. See\\nthe next section for more information about route types in GTFS.\\n\\nThere is no agency ID value in this feed, as TriMet is the only agency\\nrepresented in the feed.\\n\\nThe other thing to note about this data is that TriMet use the same\\nvalue for both `route_id` and `route_short_name`. This is very\\nuseful, because it means if you have a user that wants to save\\ninformation about a particular route you can trust the `route_id`\\nvalue. Unfortunately, this is not the case in all GTFS feeds. Sometimes,\\nthe `route_id` value may change with every version of a feed (or at\\nleast, semi-frequently). Additionally, some feeds may also have multiple\\nroutes with the same `route_short_name`. This can present challenges\\nwhen trying to save user data.\\n\\n### Route Types\\n\\nTo indicate a route's mode of transport, the `route_type` column is\\nused.\\n\\n| Value | Description       |\\n| :---- | :---------------- |\\n| `0`   | Tram / Light Rail |\\n| `1`   | Subway / Metro    |\\n| `2`   | Rail              |\\n| `3`   | Bus               |\\n| `4`   | Ferry             |\\n| `5`   | Cable Car         |\\n| `6`   | Gondola           |  \\n| `7`   | Funicular         |\\n\\nAgencies may interpret the meaning of these route types differently. For\\ninstance, some agencies specify their subway service as rail (value of\\n`2` instead of `1`), while some specify their trains as light rail\\n(`0` instead of `2`).\\n\\nThese differences between agencies occur mainly because of the vague\\ndescriptions for each of these route types. If you use Google Transit to\\nfind directions, you may notice route types referenced that are\\ndifferent to those listed above. This is because Google Transit also\\nsupports additional route types. You can read more about these\\nadditional route types at\\n<https://support.google.com/transitpartners/answer/3520902?hl=en>.\\n\\nVery few GTFS feeds made available to third-party developers actually\\nmake use of these values, but it is useful to know in case you come\\nacross one that does. For instance, Sydney Buses include their school\\nbuses with a route type of `712`, while other buses in the feed have\\nroute type `700`.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '## 5. Trips (trips.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nThe `trips.txt` file contains trips for each route. The specific stop\\ntimes are specified in `stop_times.txt`, and the days each trip runs\\non are specified in `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `route_id` | Required | The ID of the route a trip belongs to as it appears in `routes.txt`. |\\n| `service_id` | Required | The ID of the service as it appears in `calendar.txt` or `calendar_dates.txt`, which identifies the dates on which a trip runs. |\\n| `trip_id` | Required | A unique identifier for a trip in this file. This value is referenced in `stop_times.txt` when specifying individual stop times. |\\n| `trip_headsign` | Optional | The text that appears to passengers as the destination or description of the trip. Mid-trip changes to the headsign can be specified in `stop_times.txt`. |\\n| `trip_short_name` | Optional | A short name or code to identify the particular trip, different to the route\\'s short name. This may identify a particular train number or a route variation. |\\n| `direction_id` | Optional | Indicates the direction of travel for a trip, such as to differentiate between an inbound and an outbound trip. |\\n| `block_id` | Optional | A block is a series of trips conducted by the same vehicle. This ID is used to group 2 or more trips together. |\\n| `shape_id` | Optional | This value references a value from `shapes.txt` to define a shape for a trip. |\\n| `wheelchair_accessible` | Optional | `0` or blank indicates unknown, while `1` indicates the vehicle can accommodate at least one wheelchair passenger. A value of `2` indicates no wheelchairs can be accommodated. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nConsider the following extract, taken from the `trips.txt` file of the\\nTriMet GTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `route_id` | `service_id` | `trip_id`   | `direction_id` | `block_id` | `shape_id` |\\n| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282257     | 0              | 103        | 185327     |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282256     | 0              | 101        | 185327     |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282255     | 0              | 102        | 185327     |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282254     | 0              | 103        | 185327     |\\n\\nThis data describes four individual trips for the \"Vermont\" bus route\\n(this was determined by looking up the `route_id` value in\\n`routes.txt`). While the values for `trip_id`, `block_id` and\\n`shape_id` are all integers in this particular instance, this is not a\\nrequirement. Just like `service_id`, there may be non-numeric\\ncharacters.\\n\\nAs each of these trips is for the same route and runs in the same\\ndirection (based on `direction_id`) they can all be represented by the\\nsame shape. Note however that this is not always be the case as some\\nagencies may start or finish trips for a single route at different\\nlocations depending on the time of the day. If this were the case, then\\nthe trip\\'s shape would differ slightly (and therefore have a different\\nshape to represent it in `shapes.txt`).\\n\\nAlthough this example does not include `trip_headsign`, many feeds do\\ninclude this value. This is useful for indicating to a passenger where\\nthe trip is headed. When the trip headsign is not provided in the feed,\\nyou can determine the destination by using the final stop in a trip.\\n\\n**Tip:** If you are determining the destination based on the final stop,\\nyou can either present the stop name to the user, or you can\\nreverse-geocode the stop\\'s coordinates to determine the its locality.\\n\\n### Blocks\\n\\nIn the preceding example, each trip has a value for `block_id`. The\\nfirst and the last trips here both have a `block_id` value of `103`.\\nThis indicates that the same physical vehicle completes both of these\\ntrips. As each of these trips go in the same direction, it is likely\\nthat they start at the same location.\\n\\nThis means there is probably another trip in the feed for the same block\\nthat exists between the trips listed here. It would likely travel from\\nthe finishing point of the first trip (`4282257`) to the starting\\npoint of the other trip (`4282254`). If you dig a little deeper in the\\nfeed you will find the trip shown in the following table.\\n\\n| `route_id` | `service_id` | `trip_id` | `direction_id` | `block_id` | `shape_id` |\\n| :--------- | :----------- | :-------- | :------------- | :--------- | :--------- |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282270   | 1              | 103        | 185330     |\\n\\nThis is a trip traveling in the opposite direction for the same block.\\nIt has a different shape ID because it is traveling in the opposite\\ndirection; a shape\\'s points must advance in the same direction a trip\\'s\\nstop times do.\\n\\n***Note:** You should perform some validation when grouping trips\\ntogether using block IDs. For instance, if trips share a block_id value\\nthen they should also have the same service_id value. You should also\\ncheck that the times do not overlap; otherwise the same vehicle would be\\nunable to service both trips.*\\n\\nIf you dig even further in this feed, there are actually seven different\\ntrips all using block `103` for the **W.378** service period. This\\nroughly represents a full day\\'s work for a single vehicle.\\n\\nFor more discussion on blocks and how to utilize them effectively, refer\\nto *Working With Trip Blocks*.\\n\\n### Wheelchair Accessibility\\n\\nSimilar to `stops.txt`, you can specify the wheelchair accessibility\\nof a specific trip using the `wheelchair_accessible` field. While many\\nfeeds do not provide this information (often because vehicles in a fleet\\ncan be changed at the last minute, so agencies do not want to guarantee\\nthis information), your wheelchair-bound users will love you if you can\\nprovide this information.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the section on `stops.txt`, it is equally important to\\ntell a user that a specific vehicle cannot accommodate wheelchairs as to\\nwhen it can. Additionally, if the stops in a feed also have wheelchair\\ninformation, then both the stop and trip must be wheelchair accessible\\nfor a passenger to be able to access a trip at the given stop.\\n\\n### Trip Direction\\n\\nOne of the optional fields in `trips.txt` is `direction_id`, which\\nis used to indicate the general direction a vehicle is traveling. At\\npresent the only possible values are `0` to represent \"inbound\" and\\n`1` to represent \"outbound\". There are no specific guidelines as to\\nwhat each value means, but the intention is that an inbound trip on a\\nparticular route should be traveling in the opposite direction to an\\noutbound trip.\\n\\nMany GTFS feeds do not provide this information. In fact, there are a\\nhandful of feeds that include two entries in `routes.txt` for each\\nroute (one for each direction).\\n\\nOne of the drawbacks of `direction_id` is that there are many routes\\nfor which \"inbound\" or \"outbound\" do not actually mean anything. Many\\ncities have loop services that start and finish each trip at the same\\nlocation. Some cities have one or more loops that travel in both\\ndirections (generally indicated by \"clockwise loop\" and\\n\"counter-clockwise loop\", or words to that effect). In these instances,\\nthe `direction_id` can be used to determine which direction the route\\nis traveling.\\n\\n### Trip Short Name\\n\\nThe `trip_short_name` field that appears in `trips.txt` is used to\\nprovide a vehicle-specific code to a particular trip on a route. Based\\non GTFS feeds that are currently in publication, it appears there are\\ntwo primary use-cases for this field:\\n\\n* Specifying a particular train number for all trains on a route\\n* Specifying a route \"sub-code\" for a route variant.\\n\\n### Specifying a Train Number\\n\\nFor certain commuter rail systems, such as SEPTA in Philadelphia or MBTA\\nin Boston, each train has a specific number associated with it. This\\nnumber is particularly meaningful to passengers as trains on the same\\nroute may have different stopping patterns or even different features\\n(for instance, only a certain train may have air-conditioning or\\nwheelchair access).\\n\\nConsider the following extract from SEPTA\\'s rail feed\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/septa>).\\n\\n| `route_id` | `service_id` | `trip_id`    | `trip_headsign`          | `block_id` | `trip_short_name` |\\n| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |\\n| AIR        | S5           | AIR_1404_V25 | Center City Philadelphia | 1404       | 1404              |\\n| AIR        | S1           | AIR_402_V5   | Center City Philadelphia | 402        | 402               |\\n| AIR        | S1           | AIR_404_V5   | Center City Philadelphia | 404        | 404               |\\n| AIR        | S5           | AIR_406_V25  | Center City Philadelphia | 406        | 406               |\\n\\nIn this data, there are four different trains all heading to the same\\ndestination. The `trip_short_name` is a value that can safely be\\npresented to users as it has meaning to them. In this case, you could\\npresent the first trip to passengers as:\\n\\n**\"Train 1404 on the Airport line heading to Center City\\nPhiladelphia.\"**\\n\\nIn this particular feed, SEPTA use the same value for\\n`trip_short_name` and for `block_id`, because the train number\\nbelongs to a specific train. This means after it completes the trip to\\nCenter City Philadelphia it continues on. In this particular feed, the\\nfollowing trip also exists:\\n\\n**\"Train 1404 on the Warminster line heading to Glenside.\"**\\n\\nYou can therefore think of the `trip_short_name` value as a\\n\"user-facing\" version of `block_id`.\\n\\n### Specifying a Route Sub-Code\\n\\nThe other use-case for `trip_short_name` is for specifying a route\\nsub-code. For instance, consider an agency that has a route with short\\nname `100` that travels from stop `S1` to stop `S2`. At night the\\nagency only has a limited number of routes running, so they extend this\\nroute to also visit stop `S3` (so it travels from `S1` to `S2`\\nthen to `S3`). As it is a minor variation of the main path, the agency\\ncalls this trip `100A`.\\n\\nThe agency could either create a completely separate entry in\\n`routes.txt` (so they would have `100` and `100A`), or they can\\noverride the handful of trips in the evening by setting the\\n`trip_short_name` to `100A`. The following table shows how this\\nexample might be represented.\\n\\n| `route_id` | `trip_id` | `service_id` | `trip_short_name` |\\n| ---------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------------- |\\n| 100        | T1        | C1           |                   |\\n| 100        | T2        | C1           |                   |\\n| 100        | T3        | C1           |                   |\\n| 100        | T4        | C1           | 100A              |\\n\\nIn this example the `trip_short_name` does not need to be set for the\\nfirst three trips as they use the `route_short_name` value from\\n`routes.txt`.\\n\\n### Specifying Bicycle Permissions\\n\\nA common field that appears in many GTFS fields is\\n`trip_bikes_allowed`, which is used to indicate whether or not\\npassengers are allowed to take bicycles on board. This is useful for\\nautomated trip planning when bicycle options can be included in the\\nresults.\\n\\nThe way this field works is similar to the wheelchair information; `0`\\nor empty means no information provided; `1` means no bikes allowed;\\nwhile `2` means at least one bike can be accommodated.\\n\\n**Note:** Unfortunately, this value is backwards when you compare it to\\nwheelchair accessibility fields. For more discussion on this matter,\\nrefer to the topic on the Google Group for GTFS Changes\\n(<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/gtfs-changes/rEiSeKNc4cs/discussion>).\\n\\n',\n",

The first stop is selected.\\n\\n![Stop Times](images/stop-times.png)\\n\\n### Arrival Time vs. Departure Time\\n\\nThe first thing to notice about this data is that the values in\\n`arrival_time` and `departure_time` are the same. In reality, most\\nof the time these values are the same. The situation where these values\\ndiffer is typically when a vehicle is required to wait for a period of\\ntime before departing. For instance:\\n\\n**\"The train departs the domestic airport at 6:30am, arrives at the\\ninternational terminal at 6:35am. It waits for 10 minutes for passengers\\nwho have just landed to board, then departs for the city at 6:45am.\"**\\n\\nWhile this is not typically something you need to worry about, be aware\\nthat some feeds differ and the holdover time could be large. A person\\nrushing to a train wants to know the time it departs, while a husband\\nwaiting at a stop to meet his wife wants to know what time it arrives.\\n\\n**Note:** In a situation where the difference between the arrival time\\nand departure is small, you may be better off always displaying the\\nearlier time to the user. The driver may view a one or two minute\\nholdover as an opportunity to keep on time, whereas a ten or fifteen\\nminute holdover is unlikely to be ignored as doing so would\\nsignificantly alter the schedule.\\n\\n### Scheduling Past Midnight\\n\\nOne of the most important concepts to understand about\\n`stop_times.txt` is that times later than midnight can be specified.\\nFor example, if a trip starts at 11:45 PM and takes an hour to complete,\\nits finishing time is 12:45 AM the next day.\\n\\nThe `departure_time` value for the first stop is be `23:45:00`,\\nwhile the `arrival_time` value for the final stop is `24:45:00`.\\nIf you were to specify the final arrival time as `00:45:00`, it\\nwould be referencing 12:45 AM prior to the trip\\'s starting time.\\n\\nWhile you could use the `stop_sequence` to determine which day the\\ntrip fell on, it would be impossible to do a quick search purely based\\non the given final stop.\\n\\nA trip may start and finish after midnight without being considered as\\npart of the next day\\'s service. Many transit systems shut down\\novernight, but may have a few services that run after midnight until\\nabout 1 AM or 2 AM. It is logical to group them all together with the\\nsame service as earlier trips, which this functionality allows you to\\ndo.\\n\\nHowever, this has implications when searching for trips. For instance,\\nif you want to find all trips between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM on 30 January\\n2014, then you need to search:\\n\\n* Between `00:00:00` and `01:00:00` for trips with service on `20140130`\\n* Between `24:00:00` and `25:00:00` for trips with service on` 20140129`\\n\\nIn *Searching for Trips* you can see how to apply this to your\\ntrip searches.\\n\\n### Time Points\\n\\nMost GTFS feeds provide arrival/departure times for every single stop.\\nIn reality, most agencies do not have known times (or at least, they do\\nnot publish times) for many of their stops.\\n\\nTypically, for routes that describe trains, subways or ferries that make\\nrelatively few stops in a trip, all stops have a specified time.\\nHowever, often for bus routes that may make many stops in a single trip,\\ngenerally only the main stops have times shown on printed schedules.\\n\\nTypically, the bus drivers are required to meet these time points; if\\nthey are ahead of schedule they might wait at a time point until the\\nscheduled time; if they are running late they might try to catch up in\\norder to adhere to the specified time point.\\n\\nThis means that the intermediate points are likely estimates that have\\nbeen interpolated based on the amount of time between time points. If\\nthere are multiple stops in-between the time points then the distance\\nbetween stops may also be used to calculate the estimate.\\n\\nIn actual fact, GTFS feeds do not have to specify times for all stops.\\nThe data in the following table is perfectly valid for a trip.\\n\\n| `trip_id` | `arrival_time` | `stop_id` | `stop_sequence` | `shape_dist_traveled` |\\n| :-------- | :------------- | :-------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- |\\n| T1        | 10:00:00       | S1        | 1               | 0                     |\\n| T1        |                | S2        | 2               | 1500                  |\\n| T1        |                | S3        | 3               | 3000                  |\\n| T1        | 10:12:00       | S4        | 4               | 6000                  |\\n\\nBased on this data, without taking into account the distance traveled,\\nyou may estimate that the second stop arrives at 10:04 AM while the\\nthird stop arrives at 10:08.\\n\\nIf you consider the distance traveled, you might conclude the second\\nstop arrives at 10:03 AM while the third stop arrives at 10:06 AM.\\n\\nSome agencies include an additional column in `stop_times.txt` called\\n`timepoint`. This is used when they specify the times for all stops\\nbut also want to indicate if only certain stops are guaranteed times.\\n\\nThe following table shows how this would look using the previous data as\\nits basis.\\n\\n|  `trip_id` | `arrival_time` | `stop_id` | `stop_sequence` | `shape_dist_traveled` | `timepoint` |\\n| :--------- | :------------- | :-------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- | :---------- |\\n|  T1        | 10:00:00       | S1        | 1               | 0                     | 1           |\\n|  T1        | 10:03:00       | S2        | 2               | 1500                  | 0           |\\n|  T1        | 10:06:00       | S3        | 3               | 3000                  | 0           |\\n|  T1        | 10:12:00       | S4        | 4               | 6000                  | 1           |\\n\\nThis can be especially useful if you want to highlight these time points\\nso as to represent the printed schedules accurately, or even if you are\\na transit agency just using the data for internal reporting.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '## 7. Trip Schedules (calendar.txt & calendar_dates.txt)\\n\\n*Each of these files are ***optional*** in a GTFS feed, but at least one\\nof them is ***required***.*\\n\\nThe `calendar.txt` file is used to indicate the range of dates on\\nwhich trips are running. It works by including a start date and a finish\\ndate (typically a range of 3-6 months), then a marker for each day of\\nthe week on which it operates. If there are single-day scheduling\\nchanges that occur during this period, then the `calendar_dates.txt`\\nfile can be used to override the schedule for each of these days.\\n\\nThe following table shows the specification for `calendar.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `service_id` | Required | A unique ID for a single service. This value is referenced by trips in `trips.txt`. |\\n| `start_date` | Required | This indicates the start date for a given service, in `YYYYMMDD` format. |\\n| `end_date` | Required | This indicates the end date for a given service, in `YYYYMMDD` format. |\\n| `monday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Mondays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `tuesday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Tuesdays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `wednesday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Wednesdays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `thursday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Thursdays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `friday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Fridays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `saturday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Saturdays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `sunday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Sundays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the `calendar_dates.txt` file is used to define\\nexceptions to entries in `calendar.txt`. For instance, if a 3-month\\nservice is specified in `calendar.txt` and a holiday lies on a Monday\\nduring this period, then you can use calendar_dates.txt to override this\\nsingle date.\\n\\nIf the weekend schedule were used for a holiday, then you would add a\\nrecord to remove the regular schedule for the holiday date, and another\\nrecord to add the weekend schedule for the holiday date.\\n\\nSome feeds choose only to include `calendar_dates.txt` and not\\n`calendar.txt`, in which case there is an \"add service\" record for\\nevery service and every date in this file.\\n\\nThe following table shows the specification for `calendar_dates.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `service_id` | Required | The service ID that an exception is being defined for. This is referenced in both `calendar.txt` and in `trips.txt`. Unlike `calendar.txt`, it is possible for a `service_id` value to appear multiple times in this file. |\\n| `date` | Required | The date for which the exception is occurring, in `YYYYMMDD` format. |\\n| `exception_type` | Required | This indicates whether the exception is denoting an added service (`1`) or a removed service (`2`). |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following is an extract from the `calendar.txt` file in Adelaide\\nMetro\\'s GTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/adelaide-metro>). This\\nextract includes schedules from the start of 2014 until the end of March\\n2014.\\n\\n| `service_id` | `monday` | `tuesday` | `wednesday` | `thursday` | `friday` | `saturday` | `sunday` | `start_date` | `end_date` |\\n| :----------- | :------- | :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------- | :--------- | :------- | :----------- | :--------- |\\n| 1            | 1        | 1         | 1           | 1          | 1        | 0          | 0        | 20140102     | 20140331   |\\n| 11           | 0        | 0         | 0           | 0          | 0        | 1          | 0        | 20140102     | 20140331   |\\n| 12           | 0        | 0         | 0           | 0          | 0        | 0          | 1        | 20140102     | 20140331   |\\n\\nAny trip in the corresponding `trips.txt` file with a `service_id`\\nvalue of `1` runs from Monday to Friday. Trips with a `service_id`\\nof `11` run only on Saturday, while those with `12` run only on\\nSunday.\\n\\nNow consider an extract from `calendar_dates.txt` from the same feed,\\nas shown in the following table.\\n\\n| `service_id` | `date`   | `exception_type` |\\n| ------------ | -------- | ---------------- |\\n| 1            | 20140127 | 2                |\\n| 1            | 20140310 | 2                |\\n| 12           | 20140127 | 1                |\\n| 12           | 20140310 | 1                |\\n\\nThe first two rows mean that on January 27 and March 10 trips with\\n`service_id` of `1` are not running. The final two rows mean that on\\nthose same dates trips with `service_id` of `12` are running. This\\nhas the following meaning:\\n\\n**\"On 27 January and 10 March, use the Sunday timetable instead of the\\nMonday-Friday timetable.\"**\\n\\nIn Adelaide, these two dates are holidays (Australia Day and Labour\\nDay). It is Adelaide Metro\\'s policy to run their Sunday timetable on\\npublic holidays, which is reflected by the above records in their\\n`calendar_dates.txt` file.\\n\\n### Structuring Services\\n\\nThe case described above is the ideal case for specifying services in a\\nGTFS feed (dates primarily specified in `calendar.txt` with a handful\\nof exceptions in `calendar_dates.txt`).\\n\\nBe aware that there are two other major ways that services are specified\\nin feeds.\\n\\n1.  Using only `calendar_dates.txt` and expressly including every\\n    single date within the service range. Each of these is included as\\n    \"service added\" (an `exception_type` value of `1`). The\\n    following table shows how this might look.\\n\\n| `service_id` | `date`   | `exception_type` |\\n| :----------- | :------- | :--------------- |\\n|  1           | 20140102 | 1                |\\n|  1           | 20140103 | 1                |\\n|  11          | 20140104 | 1                |\\n|  12          | 20140105 | 1                |\\n\\n2.  Not using `calendar_dates.txt`, but creating many records in\\n    `calendar.txt` instead to span various dates. The following table\\n    shows how you can represent Monday-Friday from the sample data in\\n    this fashion.\\n\\n| `service_id` | `monday` | `tuesday` | `wednesday` | `thursday` | `friday` | `saturday` | `sunday` | `start_date` | `end_date` |\\n| :----------- | :------- | :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------- | :--------- | :------- | :----------- | :--------- |\\n| 1a           | 1        | 1         | 1           | 1          | 1        | 0          | 0        | 20140102     | 20140126   |\\n| holiday1     | 1        | 0         | 0           | 0          | 0        | 0          | 0        | 20140127     | 20140127   |\\n| 1b           | 1        | 1         | 1           | 1          | 1        | 0          | 0        | 20140128     | 20140309   |\\n| holiday2     | 1        | 0         | 0           | 0          | 0        | 0          | 0        | 20140310     | 20140310   |\\n| 1c           | 1        | 1         | 1           | 1          | 1        | 0          | 0        | 20140311     | 20140331   |\\n\\nIn this example, each holiday has its own row in `calendar.txt` that\\nruns for a single day only.\\n\\nRefer to *Finding Service IDs* to see how to determine\\nservices that are running for a given day.\\n\\n### Service Name\\n\\nThere are a number of feeds that specify a column in `calendar.txt`\\ncalled `service_name`. This is used to give a descriptive name to each\\nservice. For example, the Sedona Roadrunner in Arizona\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/sedona-roadrunner>) has services called\\n\"Weekday Service\", \"Weekend Service\" and \"New Year\\'s Eve Service\".\\n\\n',\n",

It must only appear once in this file. |\\n| `price` | Required | This field specifies the cost of the fare. For instance, if a trip costs $2 USD, then this value should be either `2.00` or `2`, and the `currency_type` should be `USD`. |\\n| `currency_type` | Required | This is the currency code that `price` is specified in, such as USD for United States Dollar. |\\n| `payment_method` | Required | This indicates when the fare is to be paid. `0` means it can be paid on board, while `1` means it must be paid before boarding. |\\n| `transfers` | Required | The number of transfers that may occur. This must either be empty (unlimited) transfers, or the number of transfers. |\\n| `transfer_duration` | Optional | This is the number of seconds a transfer is valid for. |\\n\\nThe following table shows the specification for `fare_rules.txt`,\\nwhich defines the rules used to apply a fare to a particular trip.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `fare_id` | Required | This is the ID of the fare that a rule applies to as it appears in `fare_attributes.txt`. |\\n| `route_id` | Optional | The ID of a route as it appears in `routes.txt` for which this rule applies. If there are several routes with the same fare attributes, there may be a row in `fare_rules.txt` for each route. |\\n| `origin_id` | Optional | This value corresponds to a `zone_id` value from `stops.txt`. If specified, this means a trip must begin in the given zone in order to qualify for this fare. |\\n| `destination_id` | Optional | This value corresponds to a `zone_id` value from `stops.txt`. If specified, this means a trip must begin in the given zone in order to qualify for this fare. |\\n| `contains_id` | Optional | This value corresponds to a `zone_id` value from `stops.txt`. If specified, this means a trip must pass through every `contains_id` zone for the given fare (in other words, several rules may need to be checked). |\\n\\nNote that aside from `fare_id`, all fields are optional in this file.\\nThis means some very complex rules can be made (especially when\\ntransfers come into the calculation).

In this particular feed, bus stops\\nhave a `zone_id` of `B`, while rail stops have `R`.\\n\\nThe fares in this file are as follows:\\n\\n* Fare `B`. If you start at a bus stop (`zone_id` value of `B`),\\n  you can buy your ticket on board (`payment_method` of `0`). You\\n  may transfer an unlimited number (empty transfers value) for 2 hours\\n  (`transfer_duration` of `7200`). The cost is $2.50 USD.\\n* Fare `R`. If you start at a rail stop, you must pre-purchase your\\n  ticket. You may transfer an unlimited number of times to other rail\\n  services for up to 2 hours. The cost is $2.50 USD.\\n\\nThe `BR` fare describes a trip that begins on a bus then transfers to\\na rail service (while `RB` is the opposite). This fare is not be\\nmatched if the passenger does not travel on both, as all `contains_id`\\nvalues must be matched in order to apply a fare.\\n\\nThe other fares (`SC`, `AT` and `VT`) all apply to their\\nrespective `route_id` values, regardless of start and finish stops.\\nTickets must be pre-purchased, and transfers are not allowed. The `VT`\\nfare (which corresponds to TriMet's Vintage Trolley) is free to ride\\nsince it has a price of `0`.\\n\\n### Assigning Fares to Agencies\\n\\nOne of the extensions available to `fare_attributes.txt` is to include\\nan `agency_id` column. This is to limit a specific fare to only routes\\nfrom the specified agency, in the case where a feed has multiple\\nagencies.\\n\\nThis is useful because there may be two agencies in a feed that define\\nfares with no specific rules (in other words, the fare applies to all\\ntrips). If the price differs, then GTFS dictates that the cheapest fare\\nis always applied. Using `agency_id` means these fares can be\\ndifferentiated accordingly.\\n\\nFor more information about this extension, refer to the Google Transit\\nGTFS Extensions page at\\n<https://support.google.com/transitpartners/answer/2450962>.\\n\\n\",\n",

In actual fact,\\nit does not really matter, just as long as the units are the same as in\\n`stop_times.txt`.\\n\\nIf you need to present a distance to your users (such as how far you\\nneed to travel on a bus), you can calculate it instead by adding up the\\ndistance between each point and formatting it based on the user's\\nlocale settings.\\n\\n### Point Sequences\\n\\nIn most GTFS feeds the `shape_pt_sequence` value starts at 1 and\\nincrements by 1 for every subsequent point. Additionally, points are\\ntypically listed in order of their sequence.\\n\\nYou should not rely on these two statements though, as this is not a\\nrequirement of GTFS. Many transit agencies have automated systems that\\nexport their GTFS from a separate system, which can sometimes result in\\nan unpredictable output format.\\n\\nFor instance, a trip that has stop times listed with the sequences `1`, `2`,\\n`9`, `18`, `7`, `3` is perfectly valid.\\n\\n### Distance Travelled\\n\\nThe `shape_dist_traveled` column is used so you can programmatically\\ndetermine how much of a shape to draw when showing a map to users of\\nyour web site or app. If you use techniques in *Optimizing Shapes*\\nto reduce the file size of shape data, then it becomes difficult to\\nuse this value.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can calculate portions of shapes by determining which\\npoint in a shape travels closest to the start and finish points of a\\ntrip.\\n\\n\",\n",

Repeating Trips (frequencies.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***optional*** in a GTFS feed.*\\n\\nIn some cases a route may repeat a particular stopping pattern every few\\nminutes (picture a subway line that runs every 5 minutes). Rather than\\nincluding entries in `trips.txt` and `stop_times.txt` for every\\nsingle occurrence, you can include the trip once then define rules for\\nit to repeat for a period of time.\\n\\nHaving a trip repeat only works in the case where the timing between\\nstops remains consistent for all stops.

The first (`T1`) should be presented in a manner such as:\\n\\n**\"Between 9 AM and 10 AM this trip departs every 5 minutes.\"**\\n\\nThe second trip (`T2`) should be presented as follows:\\n\\n**\"This trip departs at 9 AM, 9:05 AM, 9:10 AM, ...\"**\\n\\nWhile ultimately the meaning is the same, this difference is used in\\norder to allow agencies to represent their schedules more accurately.\\nOften, schedules that convey to passengers that they will not have to\\nwait more than five minutes do so without having to explicitly list\\nevery departure time.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"## 11. Stop Transfers (transfers.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***optional*** in a GTFS feed.*\\n\\nTo define how passengers can transfer between routes at specific stops\\nfeed providers can include `transfers.txt`. This does not mean\\npassengers cannot transfer elsewhere, but it does indicate if a transfer\\nis not possible between certain stops, or a minimum time required if\\ntransfer is possible.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `from_stop_id` | Required | The ID of stop as it appears in `stops.txt` where the connection begins. If this references a station, then this rule applies to all stops within the station. |\\n| `to_stop_id` | Required | The ID of the stop as it appears in `stops.txt` where the connection between trips ends. If this references a station, then this rule applies to all stops within the station. |\\n| `transfer_type` | Required | `0` or blank means the recommended transfer point, `1` means the secondary vehicle will wait for the first, `2` means a minimum amount of time is required, `3` means transfer is not possible. |\\n| `min_transfer_time` | Optional | If the `transfer_type` value is `2` then this value must be specified. It indicates the number of seconds required to transfer between the given stops. |\\n\\nIt is also possible that records in this file are specified for\\nticketing reasons. For instance, some train stations are set up so that\\npassengers can transfer between routes without needing to validate their\\nticket again or buy a transfer. Other stations that are shared between\\nthose same routes might not have this open transfer area, thereby\\nrequiring you to exit one route fully before buying another ticket to\\naccess the second.\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following table shows some sample transfer rules from TriMet in\\nPortland's GTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `from_stop_id` | `to_stop_id` | `transfer_type` | `min_transfer_time` |\\n| :------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------ |\\n| 7807           | 5020         | 0               |                     |\\n| 7807           | 7634         | 0               |                     |\\n| 7807           | 7640         | 0               |                     |\\n\\nThese rules indicate that if you are transferring from a route that\\nvisits stop `7807` to any route that visits the other stops (`5020`,\\n`7634` or `7640`), then this is the ideal place to do it.\\n\\nIn other words, if there are other locations along the first route where\\nyou could transfer to the second route, then those stops should not be\\nused. These rules say this is the best place to transfer.\\n\\nConsider the transfer rule in the following table, taken from the New\\nYork City Subway GTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/mta/79>).\\n\\n| `from_stop_id` | `to_stop_id` | `transfer_type` | `min_transfer_time` |\\n| :------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------ |\\n| 121            | 121          | 2               | 180                 |\\n\\nIn this data, the MTA specifies how long it takes to transfer to\\ndifferent platforms within the same station. The stop with ID 121 refers\\nto the 86th St station (as specified in `stops.txt`). It has a\\n`location_type` of `1` and two stops within it (`121N` and\\n`121S`). The above transfer rule says that if you need to transfer\\nfrom `121N` to `121S` (or vice-versa) then a minimum time of 3\\nminutes (180 seconds) must be allocated.\\n\\nIf you were to calculate the time taken to transfer using the\\ncoordinates of each of these platforms, it would only take a few seconds\\nas they are physically close to each other. In reality though, you must\\nexit one platform then walk around and enter the other platform (often\\nhaving to use stairs).\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '## 13. Importing a GTFS Feed to SQL\\n\\nOne of the great things about GTFS is that it is already in a format\\nconducive to being used in an SQL database. The presence of various IDs\\nin each of the different files makes it easy to join the tables in order\\nto extract the data you require.\\n\\nTo try this yourself, download `GtfsToSql`\\n(<https://github.com/OpenMobilityData/GtfsToSql>). This is a Java\\ncommand-line application that imports a GTFS feed to an SQLite database.\\nThis application also supports PostgreSQL, but the examples used here\\nare for SQLite.\\n\\nThe pre-compiled `GtfsToSql` Java archive can be downloaded from its\\nGitHub repository at\\n<https://github.com/OpenMobilityData/GtfsToSql/tree/master/dist>.\\n\\nTo use `GtfsToSql`, all you need is an extracted GTFS feed. The\\nfollowing instructions demonstrate how you to import the TriMet feed\\nthat has been referenced throughout this book.\\n\\nFirstly, download and extract the feed. The following commands use curl\\nto download the file, then unzip to extract the file to a sub-directory\\ncalled `trimet`.\\n\\n```\\n$ curl http://developer.trimet.org/schedule/gtfs.zip > gtfs.zip\\n\\n$ unzip gtfs.zip -d trimet/\\n```\\n\\nTo create an SQLite database from this feed, the following command can\\nbe used.\\n\\n```\\n$ java -jar GtfsToSql.jar -s jdbc:sqlite:./db.sqlite -g ./trimet\\n```\\n\\nThis may take a minute or two to complete (you will see progress as it\\nimports the feed and then creates indexes), and at the end you will have\\na GTFS database in a file called `db.sqlite`. You can then query this\\ndatabase with the command-line `sqlite3` tool, as shown in the\\nfollowing example.\\n\\n```\\n$ sqlite3 db.sqlite\\nsqlite> SELECT * FROM agency;\\n|TriMet|http://trimet.org|America/Los_Angeles|en|503-238-7433\\n\\nsqlite> SELECT * FROM routes WHERE route_type = 0;\\n90|||MAX Red Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r090.htm||\\n100|||MAX Blue Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r100.htm||\\n190|||MAX Yellow Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r190.htm||\\n193||Portland Streetcar|NS Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r193.htm||\\n194||Portland Streetcar|CL Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r194.htm||\\n200|||MAX Green Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r200.htm||\\n250|||Vintage Trolley||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r250.htm||\\n```\\n\\nThe first query above finds all agencies stored in the database, while\\nthe second finds all routes marked as Light Rail (`route_type` of\\n`0`).\\n\\n**Note: In the following chapters there are more SQL examples. All of\\nthese examples are geared towards running on an SQLite database that has\\nbeen created in this manner.**\\n\\nAll tables in this database match up with the corresponding GTFS\\nfilename (so for `agency.txt`, the table name is `agency`, while for\\n`stop_times.txt` the table name is `stop_times`). The columns in SQL\\nhave the same name as the value in the corresponding GTFS file.\\n\\n***Note:** All data imported using this tool is stored as text in the\\ndatabase. This means you may need to be careful when querying integer\\ndata. For example, ordering stop times by stop_sequence may not produce\\nexpected results (for instance, 29 as a string comes before 3). Although\\nit is a performance hit, you can change this behavior by casting the\\nvalue to integer, such as: ORDER BY stop_sequence + 0. The reason\\n`GtfsToSql` works in this way is because it is intended as a lightweight\\ntool to be able to quickly query GTFS data. I recommend rolling your own\\nimporter to treat data exactly as you need it, especially in conjunction\\nwith some of the optimization techniques recommended later in this book.*\\n\\n### File Encodings\\n\\nThe GTFS specification does not indicate whether files should be encoded\\nusing UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 or otherwise. Since a GTFS feed is not\\nnecessarily in English, you must be willing to handle an extended\\ncharacter set.\\n\\nThe GtfsToSql tool introduced above automatically detects the encoding\\nof each file using the juniversalchardet Java library\\n(<https://code.google.com/p/juniversalchardet/>).\\n\\nI recommend you take some time looking at the source code of GtfsToSql\\nto further understand this so you are aware of handling encodings\\ncorrectly if you write your own parser.\\n\\n### Optimizing GTFS Feeds\\n\\nIf you are creating a database that is to be distributed onto a mobile\\ndevice such as an iPhone or Android phone, then disk space and\\ncomputational power is at a premium. Even if you are setting up a\\ndatabase to be queried on a server only, then making the database\\nperform as quickly as possible is still important.\\n\\nIn the following chapters are techniques for optimizing GTFS feeds.\\nThere are many techniques that can be applied to improve the performance\\nof GTFS, such as:\\n\\n* Using integer identifiers rather than string identifiers (for route\\n  IDs, trip IDs, stop IDs, etc.) and creating appropriate indexes\\n* Removing redundant shape points and encoding shapes\\n* Deleting unused data\\n* Reusing repeating trip patterns.\\n\\nChanging the data to use integer IDs makes the greatest improvement to\\nperformance, but the other techniques also help significantly.\\n\\nDepending on your needs, there are other optimizations that can be made\\nto reduce file size and speed up querying of the data, but the ease of\\nimplementing them may depend on your database storage system and the\\nprogramming language used to query the data. The above list is a good\\nstarting point.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"## 14. Switching to Integer IDs\\n\\nThere are a number of instances in a GTFS feed where IDs are used, such\\nas to identify routes, trips, stops and shapes. There are no specific\\nguidelines in GTFS as to the type of data or length an ID can be. As\\nsuch, IDs in some GTFS feeds maybe anywhere up to 30 or 40 characters\\nlong.\\n\\nUsing long strings as IDs is extremely inefficient as they make the size\\nof a database much larger than it needs to be, as well as making\\nquerying the data much slower.\\n\\nTo demonstrate, consider a GTFS feed where trip IDs are 30 characters\\nlong. If there are 10,000 trips, each with an average of 30 stops in\\n`stop_times.txt`, then the IDs alone take up 9.3 MB of storage.\\nRealistically speaking, you need to index the `trip_id` field in order\\nto look up a trip's stop times quickly, which uses even more space.\\n\\nThe following SQL statements show how you might represent GTFS without\\noptimizing the identifiers. For brevity, not all fields from the GTFS\\nfeed are included here.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE trips (\\n  trip_id TEXT,\\n  route_id TEXT,\\n  service_id TEXT\\n);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX trips_trip_id ON trips (trip_id);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX trips_route_id ON trips (route_id);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX trips_service_id ON trips (service_id);\\n\\nCREATE TABLE stop_times (\\n  trip_id TEXT,\\n  stop_id TEXT,\\n  stop_sequence INTEGER\\n);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX stop_times_trip_id ON stop_times (trip_id);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX stop_times_stop_id on stop_times (stop_id);\\n```\\n\\nIf you were to add an integer column to `trips` called, say,\\n`trip_index`, then you can reference that value from `stop_times`\\ninstead of `trip_id`. The following SQL statements show this.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE trips (\\n  trip_id TEXT,\\n  trip_index INTEGER,\\n  route_id TEXT,\\n  service_id TEXT\\n);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX trips_trip_id ON trips (trip_id);\\nCREATE INDEX trips_trip_index ON trips (trip_index);\\nCREATE INDEX trips_route_id ON trips (route_id);\\nCREATE INDEX trips_service_id ON trips (service_id);\\n\\nCREATE TABLE stop_times (\\n  trip_index INTEGER,\\n  stop_id TEXT,\\n  stop_sequence INTEGER\\n);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX stop_times_trip_index ON stop_times (trip_index);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX stop_times_stop_id on stop_times (stop_id);\\n```\\n\\nThis results in a significant space saving (when you consider how large\\n`stop_times` can be), as well as being far quicker to look up stop\\ntimes based on a trip ID. Note that the original `trip_id` value is\\nretained so it can be referenced if required.\\n\\nWithout adding `trip_index`, you would use the following query to find\\nstop times given a trip ID.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM stop_times\\n  WHERE trip_id = 'SOME_LONG_TRIP_ID'\\n  ORDER BY stop_sequence;\\n```\\n\\nWith the addition of `trip_index`, you need to first find the record\\nin `trips`. This can be achieved using the following query. This is a\\nsmall sacrifice compared to performing string comparison on all stop\\ntimes.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM stop_times\\n  WHERE trip_index = (\\n    SELECT trip_index FROM trips WHERE trip_id = 'SOME_LONG_TRIP_ID'\\n  )\\n  ORDER BY stop_sequence;\\n```\\n\\nYou can make the same change for the other IDs in the feed, such as\\n`route_id` and `stop_id`. For these columns you still keep (and\\nindex) the original values in `routes` and `stops` respectively,\\nsince you may still need to look up records based on these values.\\n\\n***Note:** Even though this book recommends optimizing feeds in this\\nmanner, the remainder of examples in this book only use their original\\nIDs, in order to simplify the examples and to ensure compatibility with\\nthe `GtfsToSql` tool introduced previously.*\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"## 15. Optimizing Shapes\\n\\nShape data in a GTFS feed (that is, the records from `shapes.txt`)\\nrepresents a large amount of data. There are a number of ways to reduce\\nthis data, which can help to:\\n\\n* Speed up data retrieval\\n* Reduce the amount of data to transmit to app / web site users\\n* Speed up rendering of the shape onto a map (such as a native mobile\\n  map or a JavaScript map).\\n\\nTwo ways to reduce shape data are as follows:\\n\\n* **Reducing the number of points in a shape.** The shapes included in\\n  GTFS are often very precise and include a number of redundant\\n  points. Many of these can be removed without a noticeable loss of\\n  shape quality using the *Douglas-Peucker Algorithm*.\\n* **Encoding all points in a shape into a single value.** The *Encoded\\n  Polyline Algorithm* used in the Google Maps JavaScript API can also\\n  be used with GTFS shapes. This reduces the amount of storage\\n  required and also makes looking up all points in a shape far\\n  quicker.\\n\\n### Reducing Points in a Shape\\n\\nMany of the shapes you find in GTFS feeds are extremely detailed. They\\noften follow the exact curvature of the road and may consist of hundreds\\nor thousands of points for a trip that might have only 30 or 40 stops.\\n\\nWhile this level of detail is useful, the sheer amount of data required\\nto be rendered on a map can be a massive performance hit from the\\nperspective of retrieving the data as well as rendering on a map.\\nRealistically, shapes do not need this much detail in order to convey\\ntheir message to your users.\\n\\nConsider the following shape from Portland that has been rendered using\\nGoogle Maps. The total shape consists of 1913 points.\\n\\n![Original Shape](images/shape-original.jpg)\\n\\nCompare this now to the same shape that has had redundant points\\nremoved. The total number of points in this shape is 175, which\\nrepresents about a 90% reduction.\\n\\n![Reduced Shape](images/shape-reduced.jpg)\\n\\nIf you look closely, you can see some minor loss of detail, but for the\\nmost part, the shapes are almost identical.\\n\\nThis reduction in points can be achieved using the Douglas-Peucker\\nAlgorithm. It does so by discarding points that do not deviate\\nsignificantly between its surrounding points.\\n\\nThe Douglas-Peucker Algorithm works as follows:\\n\\n* Begin with the first and last points in the path (A and B). These\\n  are always kept.\\n* Find the point between the first and last that is furthest away from\\n  the line joining the first and last line (the orthogonal distance --\\n  see the figure below).\\n* If this point is greater than the allowed distance (the tolerance\\n  level), the point is kept (call it X).\\n* Repeat this algorithm twice: once using A as the first point and X\\n  as the last point, then again using X as the first point and B as\\n  the last point.\\n\\nThis algorithm is recursive, and continues until all points have been\\nchecked.\\n\\n***Note:** The tolerance level determines how aggressively points are\\nremoved. A higher tolerance value is less aggressive and discards less\\ndata, while a lower tolerance discards more data.*\\n\\nThe following diagram shows what orthogonal distance means.\\n\\n![Orthogonal Distance](images/orthogonal-distance.jpg)\\n\\nThe following resources provide more information about the\\nDouglas-Peucker Algorithm and describe how to implement it in your own\\nsystems:\\n\\n* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer-Douglas-Peucker_algorithm>\\n* <http://www.loughrigg.org/rdp/>\\n* <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573997/reduce-number-of-points-in-line>.\\n\\nYou can often discard about 80-90% of all shape data before seeing a\\nsignificant loss of line detail.\\n\\n### Encoding Shape Points\\n\\nA single entry in `shapes.txt` corresponds to a single point in a\\nsingle shape. Each entry includes a shape ID, a latitude and longitude.\\n\\n***Note:** The `shape_dist_traveled` field is also included, but you do not\\nstrictly need to use this field (nor the corresponding field in\\nstop_times.txt). The technique described in this section will not work\\nif you intend to use `shape_dist_traveled`.*\\n\\nThis means if you want to look up a shape by its ID, you may need to\\nretrieve several hundreds of rows from a database. Using the Encoded\\nPolyline Algorithm you can change your GTFS database so each shape is\\nrepresented by a single row in a database. This means the shape can be\\nfound much more quickly and much less data needs to be processed to\\ndetermine the shape.\\n\\nConsider the following data, taken from TriMet's `shapes.txt` file.\\nThis data represents the first five points of a shape.\\n\\n| `shape_id` | `shape_pt_lat` | `shape_pt_lon` |  `shape_pt_sequence` |  `shape_dist_traveled` |\\n| :--------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------------- | :--------------------- |\\n| `185328`   | `45.52291 `    | `-122.677372`  |  `1`                 |  `0.0`                 |\\n| `185328`   | `45.522921`    | `-122.67737`   |  `2`                 |  `3.7`                 |\\n| `185328`   | `45.522991`    | `-122.677432`  |  `3`                 |  `34.0`                |\\n| `185328`   | `45.522992`    | `-122.677246`  |  `4`                 |  `81.5`                |\\n| `185328`   | `45.523002`    | `-122.676567`  |  `5`                 |  `255.7`               |\\n\\nIf you apply the Encoded Polyline Algorithm to this data, the\\ncoordinates can be represented using the following string.\\n\\n```\\neeztGrlwkVAAML?e@AgC\\n```\\n\\nTo learn how to arrive at this value, you can read up on the Encoded\\nPolyline Algorithm at\\n<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm>.\\n\\nInstead of having every single shape point in a single table, you can\\ncreate a table that has one record per shape. The following SQL\\nstatement is a way you could achieve this.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE shapes (\\n  shape_id TEXT,\\n  encoded_shape TEXT\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThe following table shows how this data could be represented in a\\ndatabase.\\n\\n| `shape_id` | `encoded_shape`        |\\n| :--------- | :--------------------- |\\n| `185328`   | `eeztGrlwkVAAML?e@AgC` |\\n\\nStoring the shape in this manner means you can retrieve an entire shape\\nby looking up only one database row and running it through your decoder.\\n\\nTo further demonstrate how both the encoding and decoding works, try out\\nthe polyline utility at\\n<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility>.\\n\\nYou can find implementations for encoding and decoding points for\\nvarious languages at the following locations:\\n\\n* <http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/EncodePolyline/>\\n* <https://github.com/emcconville/google-map-polyline-encoding-tool>\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"## 16. Deleting Unused Data**\\n\\nOnce you have imported a GTFS feed into a database, it is possible for\\nthere to be a lot of redundant data. This can ultimately slow down any\\nquerying of that data as well as bloating the size of the database. If\\nyou are making an app where the GTFS database is queried on the device\\nthen disk space and computational time are at a premium, so you must do\\nwhat you can to reduce resource usage.\\n\\nThe first thing to check for is expired services. You can do this by\\nsearching `calendar.txt` for entries that expire before today's date.\\nBe aware though, you also need to ensure there are no\\n`calendar_dates.txt` entries overriding these services (a service\\ncould have an `end_date` of, say, `20140110`, but also have a\\n`calendar_dates.txt` entry for `20140131`).\\n\\nFirstly, find service IDs in `calendar_dates.txt` that are still\\nactive using the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates WHERE date >= '20140110';\\n```\\n\\n***Note:** In order to improve performance of searching for dates, you\\nshould import the date field in `calendar_dates.txt` as an integer, as\\nwell as `start_date` and `end_date` in `calendar.txt`.*\\n\\nAny services matched in this query should not be removed. You can then\\nfind service IDs in `calendar.txt` with the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM calendar WHERE end_date < '20140110'\\n  AND service_id NOT IN (\\n    SELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates WHERE date >= '20140110'\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nBefore deleting these services, corresponding trips and stop times must\\nbe removed since you need to know the service ID in order to delete a\\ntrip. Likewise, stop times must be deleted before trips since you need\\nto know the trip IDs to be removed.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM stop_times WHERE trip_id IN (\\n   SELECT trip_id FROM trips WHERE service_id IN (\\n     SELECT service_id FROM calendar WHERE end_date < '20140110'\\n       AND service_id NOT IN (\\n         SELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates WHERE date >= '20140110'\\n       )\\n    )\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nNow there may be a series of trips with no stop times. Rather than\\nrepeating the above sub-queries, a more thorough way of removing trips\\nis to remove trips with no stop times.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM trips WHERE trip_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT trip_id FROM stop_times\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWith all `service_id` references removed, you can remove the expired\\nrows from `calendar.txt` using the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM calendar WHERE end_date < '20140110'\\n  AND service_id NOT IN (\\n    SELECT DISTINCT service_id FROM calendar_dates WHERE date >= '20140110'\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nThe expired rows in `calendar_dates.txt` can also be removed, which\\ncan be achieved using the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM calendar_dates WHERE date < '20140110';\\n```\\n\\nThere may now be some stops that are not used by any trips. These can be\\nremoved using the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM stops WHERE stop_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT stop_id FROM stop_times\\n);\\n```\\n\\nAdditionally, you can remove unused shapes and routes using the\\nfollowing queries.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM shapes WHERE shape_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT shape_id FROM trips\\n);\\n\\nDELETE FROM routes WHERE route_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT route_id FROM trips\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThere are other potential rows that can be removed (such as records in\\n`transfers.txt` that reference non-existent stops), but hopefully you\\nget the idea from the previous queries.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '## 17. Searching for Trips**\\n\\nThis section shows you how to search for trips in a GTFS feed based on\\nspecified times and stops.\\n\\nThe three scenarios covered are:\\n\\n* Finding all stops departing from a given stop after a certain time\\n* Finding all stops arriving at a given stop before a certain time\\n* Finding all trips between two stops after a given time\\n\\nThe first and second scenarios are the simplest, because they only rely\\non a single end of each trip. The third scenario is more complex because\\nyou have to ensure that each trip returned visits both the start and\\nfinish stops.\\n\\nWhen searching for trips, the first thing you need to know is which\\nservices are running for the given search time.\\n\\n### Finding Service IDs\\n\\nThe first step in searching for trips is to determine which services are\\nrunning. To begin with, you need to find service IDs for a given date.\\nYou then need to handle exceptions accordingly. That is, you need to add\\nservice IDs and remove service IDs based on the rules in\\n`calendar_dates.txt`.\\n\\n***Note:** In *Scheduling Past Midnight*, you were shown how\\nGTFS works with times past midnight. The key takeaway from this is that\\nyou have to search for trips for two sets of service IDs. This is\\ncovered as this chapter progresses.*\\n\\nIn Australia, 27 January 2014 (Monday) was the holiday for Australia\\nDay. This is used as an example to demonstrate how to retrieve service\\nIDs.\\n\\nFirstly, you need the main set of service IDs for the day. The following\\nSQL query achieves this.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar\\n  WHERE start_date <= \\'20140127\\' AND end_date >= \\'20140127\\'\\n  AND monday = 1;\\n \\n# Result: 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, 871, 7501\\n```\\n\\nNext you need to find service IDs that are to be excluded, as achieved\\nby the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates\\n  WHERE date = \\'20140127\\' AND exception_type = 2;\\n\\n# Result: 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, 871, 7501\\n```\\n\\nFinally, you need to find service IDs that are to be added. This query\\nis identical to the previous query, except for the different\\n`exception_type` value.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates\\n  WHERE date = \\'20140127\\' AND exception_type = 1;\\n\\n# Result: 12, 874, 4303, 7003\\n```\\n\\nYou can combine these three queries all into a single query in SQLite\\nusing `EXCEPT` and `UNION`, as shown in the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar\\n  WHERE start_date <= \\'20140127\\' AND end_date >= \\'20140127\\'\\n  AND monday = 1\\n  \\nUNION\\n  \\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates\\n  WHERE date = \\'20140127\\' AND exception_type = 1\\n  \\nEXCEPT\\n  \\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates\\n  WHERE date = \\'20140127\\' AND exception_type = 2;\\n\\n# Result: 12, 874, 4304, 7003\\n```\\n\\nNow when you search for trips, only trips that have a matching\\n`service_id` value are included.\\n\\n### Finding Trips Departing a Given Stop\\n\\nIn order to determine the list of services above, a base timestamp on\\nwhich to search is needed. For the purposes of this example, assume that\\ntimestamp is 27 January 2014 at 1 PM (`13:00:00` when using GTFS).\\n\\nThis example searches for all services departing from Adelaide Railway\\nStation, which has stop ID `6665` in the Adelaide Metro GTFS feed. To\\nfind all matching stop times, the following query can be performed.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM stop_times\\n  WHERE stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND departure_time >= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND pickup_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nThis returns a series of stop times that match the given criteria. The\\nonly problem is it does not yet take into account valid service IDs.\\n\\n***Note:** This query may also return stop times that are the final stop\\non a trip, which is not useful for somebody trying to find departures.\\nYou may want to modify your database importer to override the final stop\\ntime of each trip so its `pickup_type` has a value of `1` (no pick-up) and\\nits first stop time so it has a `drop_off_type` of `1` (no drop-off).*\\n\\nTo make sure only the correct trips are returned, join `stop_times`\\nwith `trips` using `trip_id`, and then include the list of service\\nIDs. For the purposes of this example the service IDs, stop ID and\\ndeparture time are being hard-coded. You can either embed a sub-query,\\nor include the service IDs via code.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'12\\', \\'874\\', \\'4304\\', \\'7003\\')\\n  AND st.departure_time >= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st.pickup_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nThis gives you the final list of stop times matching the desired\\ncriteria. You can then decide specifically which data you need to\\nretrieve; you now have the `trip_id`, meaning you can find all stop\\ntimes for a given trip if required.\\n\\nIf you need to restrict the results to only those that occur after the\\nstarting stop, you can retrieve stop times with only a `stop_sequence`\\nlarger than that of the stop time returned in the above query.\\n\\n### Finding Trips Arriving at a Given Stop\\n\\nIn order to find the trips arriving at a given stop before a specified\\ntime, it is just a matter of making slight modifications to the above\\nquery. Firstly, check the `arrival_time` instead of\\n`departure_time`. Also, check the `drop_off_type` value instead of\\n`pickup_type`.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'12\\', \\'874\\', \\'4304\\', \\'7003\\')\\n  AND st.arrival_time <= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st.drop_off_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.arrival_time DESC;\\n```\\n\\nFor this particular data set, there are trips from four different routes\\nreturned. If you want to restrict this to a particular route, you can\\nfilter on the `t.route_id` value.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'12\\', \\'874\\', \\'4304\\', \\'7003\\')\\n  AND t.route_id = \\'BEL\\'\\n  AND st.arrival_time <= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st.drop_off_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.arrival_time DESC;\\n```\\n\\n### Performance of Searching Text-Based Times\\n\\nThese examples search using text-based arrival/departure times (such as\\n`13:00:00`). This works because the GTFS specification mandates that\\nall times are `HH:MM:SS` format (although `H:MM:SS` is allowed for times\\nearlier than 10 AM).\\n\\nDoing this kind of comparison (especially if you are scanning millions\\nof rows) is quite slow and expensive. It is more efficient to convert\\nall times stored in the database to integers that represent the number\\nof seconds since midnight.\\n\\n***Note:** The GTFS specification states that arrival and departure times\\nare \"noon minus 12 hours\" in order to account for daylight savings time.\\nThis is effectively midnight, except for the days that daylight savings\\nstarts or finishes.*\\n\\nIn order to achieve this, you can convert the text-based time to an\\ninteger with `H * 3600 + M * 60 + S`. For example, `13:35:21` can\\nbe converted using the following steps.\\n\\n```\\n  (13 * 3600) + (35 * 60) + (21)\\n= 46800 + 2100 + 21\\n= 48921\\n```\\n\\nYou can then convert back to hours, minutes and seconds in order to\\ngenerate timestamps in your application as shown in the following\\nalgorithm.\\n\\n```\\nH = floor( 48921 / 3600 )\\n  = floor( 13.59 )\\n  = 13\\n  \\nM = floor( 48921 / 60 ) % 60\\n  = floor( 815.35 ) % 60\\n  = 815 % 60\\n  = 35\\n  \\nS = 48921 % 60\\n  = 21\\n```\\n\\n### Finding Trips Between Two Stops\\n\\nNow that you know how to look up a trip from or to a given stop, the\\nprevious query can be expanded so both the start and finish stop are\\nspecified. The following example finds trips that depart after 1 PM. The\\nsearch only returns trips departing from *Adelaide Railway Station*\\n(stop ID `6665`) are shown. Additionally, only trips that then visit\\n*Blackwood Railway Station* (stop IDs `6670` and `101484`) are\\nincluded.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this, the following changes must be made to the\\nprevious examples.\\n\\n* **Join against stop_times twice.** Once for the departure stop time\\n  and once for the arrival stop time.\\n* **Allow for multiple stop IDs at one end.** The destination in this\\n  example has two platforms, so you need to check both of them.\\n* **Ensure the departure time is earlier than the arrival time.\\n  **Otherwise trips heading in the opposite direction may also be\\n  returned.\\n\\nThe following query demonstrates how this is achieved.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st1.*, st2.*\\n  FROM trips t, stop_times st1, stop_times st2\\n  WHERE st1.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND st2.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND st1.stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND st2.stop_id IN (\\'6670\\', \\'101484\\')\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'12\\', \\'874\\', \\'4304\\', \\'7003\\')\\n  AND st1.departure_time >= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st1.pickup_type = 0\\n  AND st2.drop_off_type = 0\\n  AND st1.departure_time < st2.arrival_time\\n  ORDER BY st1.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the table alias `st1` is used for the departure stop\\ntime. Once again, the stop ID must match, as well as the departure time\\nand pick-up type.\\n\\nFor the arrival stop time the alias `st2` is used. This table also\\njoins the `trips` table using `trip_id`. Since the destination has\\nmultiple stop IDs, the SQL `IN` construct is used. The arrival time is\\nnot important in this example, so only the departure is checked.\\n\\nThe final thing to check is that the departure occurs before the\\narrival. If you do not perform this step, then trips traveling in the\\nopposite direction may also be returned.\\n\\n***Note:** Technically, there may be multiple results returned for the\\nsame trip. For some transit agencies, a single trip may visit the a stop\\nmore than once. If this is the case, you should also check the trip\\nduration (arrival time minus departure time) and use the shortest trip\\nwhen the same trip is returned multiple times.*\\n\\n### Accounting for Midnight\\n\\nAs discussed previously, GTFS has the ability for the trips to depart or\\narrive after midnight for a given service day without having to specify\\nit as part of the next service day. Consequently, while the queries\\nabove are correct, they do not necessarily paint the full picture.\\n\\nIn reality, when performing a trip search, you need to take into account\\ntrips that have wrapped times (for instance, where 12:30 AM is specified\\nas `24:30:00`). If you want to find trips that depart after 12:30 AM\\non a given day, you need to check for trips departing after\\n`00:30:00` on that day, as well as for trips departing at\\n`24:30:00` on the previous day.\\n\\nThis means that for each trip search you are left with two sets of\\ntrips, which you must then merge and present as appropriate.\\n\\n***Note:** In reality, agencies generally do not have trips that overlap\\nfrom multiple service days, so technically you often only need one query\\n(for example, a train service might end on 12:30 AM then restart on the\\nnext service day at 4:30 AM). If your app / web site only uses a single\\nfeed where you can tune your queries manually based on how the agency\\noperates, then you can get away with only querying a single service day.\\nOn the other hand, if you are building a scalable system that works with\\ndata from many agencies, then you need to check both days.*\\n\\nTo demonstrate how this works in practice, the following example\\nsearches for all trips that depart after 12:30:00 AM on 14 March 2014.\\nThe examples earlier in this chapter showed how to find the service IDs\\nfor a given date. To account for midnight, service IDs for both March 14\\n(the \"main\" service date) and March 13 (the overlapping date) need to be\\ndetermined.\\n\\nAssume that March 13 has a service ID of `C1` and March 14 has a\\nservice ID of `C2`. First you need to find the departures for March\\n14, as shown in the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'S1\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'C1\\')\\n  AND st.departure_time >= \\'00:30:00\\'\\n  AND st.pickup_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nThe resultant list needs to be combined with the trips that depart after\\nmidnight from the March 13 service. To check this, it is just a matter\\nof swapping in the right service IDs, then adding 24 hours to the search\\ntime.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'S1\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'C2\\')\\n  AND st.departure_time >= \\'24:30:00\\'\\n  AND st.pickup_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nIn order to get your final list of trips you must combine the results\\nfrom both of these queries. If you are generating complete timestamps in\\norder to present the options to your users, just remember to account for\\nthe results from the second query being 24 hours later.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"## 18. Working With Trip Blocks**\\n\\nOne of the more complex aspects of GTFS is how to properly use the\\n`block_id` field in `trips.txt`. The concept is simple, but\\nincorporating this information in a manner that is simple to understand\\nfor a passenger can be more difficult.\\n\\nA single vehicle (such as a bus or train) completes multiple trips in a\\nsingle service day. For instance, once a bus completes its trip (Trip X)\\nfrom Location A to Location B, it then begins another trip (Trip Y) from\\nLocation B to Location C. It then completes a final trip (Trip Z) from\\nLocation C back to Location A.\\n\\nIf a passenger boards in the middle of Trip X and is allowed to stay on\\nthe bus until the end of the Trip Y, then this should be represented in\\nGTFS by giving Trips X, Y, Z the same `block_id` value.\\n\\nThe following diagram shows a vehicle that performs two trips,\\ncompleting opposite directions of the same route. Often a single vehicle\\nwill do many more than just two trips in a day.\\n\\n![Block](images/block-01.png)\\n\\n***Note:** When trips in a block are represented in stop_times.txt, the\\nfinal stop of a trip and the first stop of the subsequent trip must both\\nbe included, even though they are typically at the same stop (and often\\nthe same arrival & departure time). The final stop of the first trip is\\ndrop-off only, while the first stop of the next trip is pick-up only.*\\n\\nIn the following diagram, the vehicle completes three trips, each for\\nseparate routes. As in the previous diagram, the vehicle will likely\\ncomplete more trips over a single day.\\n\\n![Block](images/block-02.png)\\n\\nThese two diagrams show the difficulties that can arise when trying to\\ncalculate trips across multiple blocks. The first diagram is repeated\\nbelow, this time with stops marked so trips between two locations can be\\nfound.\\n\\n![Block](images/block-03.png)\\n\\nConsider the scenario where you want to retrieve all trip times from\\nStop S2 to Stop S1. Since the vehicle gets to Stop S3 then turns around\\nand heads back to S1, the trip search returns two options:\\n\\n1. Board at S2 on the upper trip, travel via S3, then get to S1.\\n2. Board at S2 on the lower trip, travel directly to S1.\\n\\nThe second option is a subset of the first option, which means it is a\\nfar shorter trip (plus it avoids the passenger getting annoyed from\\npassing their starting point again). To determine which option to use,\\nyou can use the trip duration.\\n\\nNow consider the other type of block formation, where a vehicle\\ncompletes subsequent trips from different routes.\\n\\n![Block](images/block-04.png)\\n\\nIf a passenger wants to travel from Stop S2 to S4, you will not get the\\nsituation where the vehicle travels past the same location twice.\\nHowever, it is also possible for a passenger to travel from Stop S2 to\\nStop S6 without ever having to change vehicles.\\n\\nReferring back to the previous chapter about performing trip searches,\\nit is relatively straightforward to account for blocks in these\\nsearches. Using the query to find trips between two stops as a\\nreference, the following changes need to be made:\\n\\n* Instead of joining both occurrences of `stop_times` to the\\n  `trips` table, you now need two occurrences of `trips`.\\n* Each `stop_times` table occurrence is joined to a separate\\n  `trips` table occurrence.\\n* The two occurrences of `trips` are joined on the `block_id`\\n  value (if it is available).\\n\\nThe following query shows how to find trips that start at stop `S2`\\nand finish at stop `S4`, departing after 1 PM on the day with service\\nID `C1`.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t1.*, t2.*, st1.*, st2.*\\n  FROM trips t1, trips t2, stop_times st1, stop_times st2\\n  WHERE st1.trip_id = t1.trip_id\\n  AND st2.trip_id = t2.trip_id\\n  AND st1.stop_id = 'S2'\\n  AND st2.stop_id = 'S4'\\n  AND t1.service_id = 'C1'\\n  AND (\\n    t1.trip_id = t2.trip_id\\n    OR (\\n      LENGTH(t1.block_id) > 0 AND t1.block_id = t2.block_id\\n    )\\n  )\\n  AND st1.departure_time >= '13:00:00'\\n  AND st1.pickup_type = 0\\n  AND st2.drop_off_type = 0\\n  AND st1.departure_time < st2.arrival_time\\n  ORDER BY st1.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nSince `block_id` may be unpopulated, the query joins on both the\\n`trip_id` and the `block_id`.\\n\\n***Note:** An alternative is to guarantee every single trip has a\\n`block_id` value when importing -- even if some blocks only consist of\\na single trip. If you can guarantee this condition, then you can\\nsimplify this query by using `t1.block_id = t2.block_id`.*\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '## 19. Calculating Fares**\\n\\nIn order to calculate a fare for a trip in GTFS, you must use data from\\n`fare_attributes.txt` and `fare_rules.txt`. It is relatively\\nstraightforward to calculate the cost of a single trip (that is,\\nboarding a vehicle, traveling for a number of stops, then disembarking),\\nbut it becomes much more complicated when you need to take into account\\nmultiple trip segments (that is, one or more transfers).\\n\\n***Note:** As it stands, many feed providers do not include fare\\ninformation. This is because many systems have a unique set of rules\\nthat cannot be modelled with the current structure of fares in GTFS.\\nAdditionally, it is not possible to determine different classes of\\npricing (such as having a separate price for adults and children). For\\nthe purposes of this chapter, these limitations are ignored.*\\n\\nFor more discussion on how fares work in GTFS, refer to *Fare\\nDefinitions (`fare_attributes.txt` & `fare_rules.txt`)*.\\n\\nThis chapter first shows you how to calculate fares for a single trip,\\nthen how to account for transfers and for multiple trips.\\n\\n### Calculating a Single Trip Fare\\n\\nMuch of the logic used when calculating fares requires knowledge of the\\nzones used in a trip.\\n\\n***Note:** A zone is a physical area within a transit system that\\ncontains a series of stops. They are used to group trip pricing into key\\nareas in a system. Some transit systems do not work like this (for\\ninstance, they may measure the physical distance travelled rather than\\nspecific stops), which is one reason why the GTFS fares model does not\\nwork in all cases.*\\n\\nA zone is defined in GTFS by the `zone_id` column in `stops.txt`. A\\nsingle stop can only belong to one zone.\\n\\nFares are matched to a trip using a combination of any of the following:\\n\\n* The route of the trip\\n* The zone of the stop the passenger boards from\\n* The zone of the stop the passenger disembarks\\n* The zone(s) of any stops on the trip that are passed while the\\n  passenger is on board.\\n\\nConsider the following simplified data set that may appear in\\n`stops.txt` and `stop_times.txt`. Assume for this example that the\\ntrip `T1` belongs to a route with an ID of `R1`.\\n\\n```\\nstop_id,zone_id\\nS1,Z1\\nS2,Z1\\nS3,Z2\\nS4,Z3\\n\\ntrip_id,stop_id,stop_sequence\\nT1,S1,1\\nT1,S2,2\\nT1,S3,3\\nT1,S4,4\\n```\\n\\nIf a passenger travels from stop S1 to stop S4, then their starting zone\\nis Z1, their finishing zone is Z3, and the zones they pass through are\\nZ1, Z2 and Z3.\\n\\n***Note:** When calculating fares, the start and finish zones are also\\nincluded in the zones passed through, so in this example you Z3 is also\\nconsidered as a zone that the trip passes through.*\\n\\nUsing this data, you can now calculate matching fares. To do so, you\\nneed to find all fares that match either of the following:\\n\\n* Fares that have no associated rules.\\n* Fares that have rules that match the specified trip. If a fare\\n  defines multiple zones that must be passed through (using\\n  `contains_id`), then all zones must be matched.\\n\\nIf multiple fares qualify for a trip, then the cheapest fare is the one\\nto use.\\n\\n### Finding Fares With No Rules\\n\\nThis is the simplest use-case for fares. You can find all matching fares\\nwith the following SQL.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM fare_attributes WHERE fare_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT fare_id FROM fare_rules\\n);\\n```\\n\\nIf a feed only has `fare_attributes.txt` records with no rules, then\\nthe difference between the fares is in the transfer rules. This section\\nonly covers calculating fares for a single trip with no transfers, so\\nfor now you can just select the cheapest fare using the following SQL.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM fare_attributes WHERE fare_id NOT IN (\\n    SELECT DISTINCT fare_id FROM fare_rules\\n  )\\n  ORDER BY price + 0 LIMIT 1;\\n```\\n\\n***Note:** You still need to check for fares with one or more rules in\\norder to find the cheapest price. Also, `0` is added in this query in\\norder to cast a string to a number. When you roll your own importer you\\nshould instead import this as a numerical value.*\\n\\n### Finding Fares With Matched Rules\\n\\nNext you must check against specific rules for a fare. In order to do\\nthis, you need the starting zone, finishing zone, and all zones passed\\nthrough (including the start and finish zones).\\n\\nReferring back to the previous example, if a trip starts at `Z1`,\\npasses through `Z2` and finishes at `Z3`, you can find fare\\ncandidates (that is, trips that *may* match), using the following SQL\\nquery.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM fare_attributes WHERE fare_id IN (\\n    SELECT fare_id FROM fare_rules\\n      WHERE (LENGTH(route_id) = 0 OR route_id = \\'R1\\')\\n      AND (LENGTH(origin_id) = 0 OR origin_id = \\'Z1\\')\\n      AND (LENGTH(destination_id) = 0 OR destination_id = \\'Z3\\')\\n      AND (LENGTH(contains_id) = 0 OR contains_id IN (\\'Z1\\', \\'Z2\\', \\'Z3\\')\\n    )\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nThis returns a list of fares that may qualify for the given trip. As\\nsome fares have multiple rules, all must be checked. The algorithm to\\nrepresent this is as follows.\\n\\n```\\nfares = [ result from above query ]\\n\\nqualifyingFares = [ ]\\n\\nfor (fare in fares) {\\n  if (qualifies(fare))\\n    qualifyingFares.add(fare)\\n}\\n\\nallFares = qualifyFares + faresWithNoRules\\n\\npassengerFare = cheapest(allFares)\\n```\\n\\nAs shown on the final two lines, once you have the list of qualifying\\nfares, you can combine these with fares that have no rules (from the\\nprevious section) and then determine the cheapest fare.\\n\\nFirst though, you must determine if a fare with rules qualifies for the\\ngiven trip. If a fare specifies zones that must be passed through, then\\nall rules must be matched.\\n\\n***Note:** If a particular rule specifies a different route, start, or\\nfinish than the one you are checking, you do not need to ensure the\\n`contains_id` matches, since this rule no longer applies. You still need\\nto check the other rules for this fare.*\\n\\nThe algorithm needs to build up a list of zone IDs from the fare rules\\nin order to check against the trip. Once this has been done, you need to\\ncheck that every zone ID collected from the rules is contained in the\\ntrip\\'s list of zones.\\n\\n```\\nqualifies(fare, routeId, originId, destinationId, containsIds) {\\n\\n  fareContains = [ ]\\n  \\n  for (rule in fare.rules) {\\n    if (rule.contains.length == 0)\\n      continue\\n      \\n    if (rule.route.length > 0 AND rule.route != routeId)\\n      continue\\n      \\n    if (rule.origin.length > 0 AND rule.origin != originId)\\n      continue\\n      \\n    if (rule.desination.length > 0 AND rule.destination != destinationId)\\n      continue\\n      \\n    fareContains.add(rule.containsId);\\n }\\n \\n if (fareContains.size == 0)\\n   return YES\\n   \\n if (containIds HAS EVERY ELEMENT IN fareContains)\\n   return YES\\n else \\n   return NO\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis algorithm achieves the following:\\n\\n* Only rules that have a value for `contains_id` are relevant. Rules\\n  that do not have this value fall through and should be considered as\\n  qualified.\\n* If the route is specified but not equal to the one being checked, it\\n  is safe to ignore the rule\\'s `contains_id`. If the route is empty\\n  or equal, the loop iteration can continue.\\n* Check for the `origin_id` and `destination_id` in the same\\n  manner as `route_id`.\\n* If the route, origin and destination all qualify then store the\\n  `contains_id` so it can be checked after the loop.\\n\\nThe algorithm returns *yes* if the fare qualifies, meaning you can save\\nit as a qualifying fare. You can then return the cheapest qualifying\\nfare to the user.\\n\\n### Calculating Trips With Transfers\\n\\nOnce you introduce transfers, fare calculation becomes more complicated.\\nA \"trip with a transfer\" is considered to be a trip where the passenger\\nboards a vehicle, disembarks, and then gets on another vehicle. For\\nexample:\\n\\n* Travel on trip T1 from Stop S1 to Stop S2\\n* Walk from Stop S2 to Stop S3\\n* Travel on trip T2 from Stop S3 to Stop S4.\\n\\nIn order to calculate the total fare for a trip with transfers, the\\nfollowing algorithm is used:\\n\\n1. Retrieve list of qualifying fares for each trip individually\\n2. Create a list of every fare combination possible\\n3. Loop over all combinations and find the total cost\\n4. Return the lowest cost from Step 3.\\n\\nStep 1 was covered in *Calculating a Single Trip Fare*, but\\nyou must skip the final step of finding the cheapest fare. This is\\nbecause the cheapest fare may change depending on subsequent transfers.\\nInstead, this step is performed once the cheapest *combination* is\\ndetermined.\\n\\nTo demonstrate Step 2, consider the following example:\\n\\n* The trip on T1 from S1 to S2 yields the following qualifying fares:\\n  F1, F2.\\n* The subsequent trip on T2 from S3 to S4 yields the following\\n  qualifying fares: F3, F4.\\n\\nGenerating every combination of these fares yields the following\\npossibilities:\\n\\n* F1 + F3\\n* F1 + F4\\n* F2 + F3\\n* F2 + F4.\\n\\nStep 3 can now be performed, which involves finding the total cost for\\neach combinations. As you need to take into account the possibility of\\ntimed transfers (according to the data stored in\\n`fare_attributes.txt`), you also need to know about the times of these\\ntrips.\\n\\nThe following algorithm can be used to calculate the total cost using\\ntransfer rules. In this example, you would call this function once for\\neach fare combination.\\n\\n```\\nfunction totalCost(fares) {\\n  total = 0\\n \\n  for (fare in fares) {\\n    freeTransfer = NO\\n \\n    if (previousFare ALLOWS TRANSFERS) {\\n      if (HAS ENOUGH TRANSFERS REMAINING) {\\n        if (TRANSFER NOT EXPIRED) {\\n          freeTransfer = YES\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n \\n    if (!freeTransfer)\\n      total = total + fare.price;\\n     \\n    previousFare = fare;\\n  }\\n \\n  return total;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOnce all combinations have called the `totalCost` algorithm, you will\\nhave a price for each trip. You can then return the lowest price as the\\nfinal price for the trip.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"## 20. Trip Patterns**\\n\\nIn a GTFS feed, a route typically has multiple trips that start and\\nfinish at the same stops. If you are looking to reduce the size of the\\ndata stored, then converting data from `stop_times.txt` into a series\\nof reusable patterns is an excellent way to do so.\\n\\nFor two trips to share a common pattern, the following must hold true:\\n\\n* The stops visited and the order in which they are visited must be the same\\n* The time differences between each stop must be the same.\\n\\nThe following table shows some fictional trips to demonstrate this.\\n\\n| **Stop** | **Trip 1** | **Trip 2** | **Trip 3** |\\n| :------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |\\n| S1       | 10:00:00   | 10:10:00   | 10:20:00   |\\n| S2       | 10:02:00   | 10:13:00   | 10:22:00   |\\n| S3       | 10:05:00   | 10:15:00   | 10:25:00   |\\n| S4       | 10:06:00   | 10:18:00   | 10:26:00   |\\n| S5       | 10:10:00   | 10:21:00   | 10:30:00   |\\n\\nIn a GTFS feed, this would correspond to 15 records in\\n`stop_times.txt`. If you look more closely though, you can see the\\ntrips are very similar. The following table shows the differences\\nbetween each stop time, instead of the actual time.\\n\\n| **Stop** | **Trip 1**      | **Trip 2**      | **Trip 3**      |\\n| :------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- |\\n| S1       | 00:00:00        | 00:00:00        | 00:00:00        |\\n| S2       | 00:02:00 (+2m)  | 00:03:00 (+3m)  | 00:02:00 (+2m)  |\\n| S3       | 00:05:00 (+5m)  | 00:05:00 (+5m)  | 00:05:00 (+5m)  |\\n| S4       | 00:06:00 (+6m)  | 00:08:00 (+8m)  | 00:06:00 (+6m)  |\\n| S5       | 00:10:00 (+10m) | 00:11:00 (+11m) | 00:10:00 (+10m) |\\n\\nYou can see from this table that the first and third trip, although they\\nstart at different times, have the same offsets between stops (as well\\nas stopping at identical stops).\\n\\nInstead of using a table to store stop times, you can store patterns. By\\nstoring the ID of the pattern with each trip, you can reduce the list of\\nstop times in this example from 15 to 10. As only time offsets are\\nstored for each patterns, the trip starting time also needs to be saved\\nwith each trip.\\n\\nYou could use SQL such as the following to model this.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE trips (\\n  trip_id TEXT,\\n  pattern_id INTEGER,\\n  start_time TEXT,\\n  start_time_secs INTEGER\\n);\\n\\nCREATE TABLE patterns (\\n  pattern_id INTEGER,\\n  stop_id TEXT,\\n  time_offset INTEGER,\\n  stop_sequence INTEGER\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThe data you would store for trips in this example is shown in the\\nfollowing table.\\n\\n| `trip_id` | `pattern_id` | `start_time` | `start_time_secs` |\\n| :-------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---------------- |\\n| T1        | 1            | 10:00:00     | 36000             |\\n| T2        | 2            | 10:10:00     | 36600             |\\n| T3        | 1            | 10:20:00     | 37200             |\\n\\n***Note:** The above table includes start_time_secs, which is an integer\\nvalue representing the number of seconds since the day started. Using\\nthe hour, minutes and seconds in start_time, this value is `H * 3600 + M * 60 + S`.*\\n\\nIn the `patterns` table, you would store data as in the following\\ntable.\\n\\n| `pattern_id` | `stop_id` | `time_offset` | `stop_sequence` |\\n| :----------- | :-------- | :------------ | :-------------- |\\n| 1            | S1        | 0             | 1               |\\n| 1            | S2        | 120           | 2               |\\n| 1            | S3        | 300           | 3               |\\n| 1            | S4        | 360           | 4               |\\n| 1            | S5        | 600           | 5               |\\n| 2            | S1        | 0             | 1               |\\n| 2            | S2        | 180           | 2               |\\n| 2            | S4        | 300           | 3               |\\n| 2            | S5        | 480           | 4               |\\n| 2            | S6        | 660           | 5               |\\n\\nAs you can see, this represents an easy way to significantly reduce the\\namount of data stored. You could have tens or hundreds of trips each\\nsharing the same pattern. When you scale this to the entire feed, this\\ncould reduce, say, 3 million records to about 200,000.\\n\\n***Note:** This is a somewhat simplified example, as there is other data\\navailable in `stop_times.txt` (such as separate arrival/departure times,\\ndrop-off type and pick-up type). You should take all of this data into\\naccount when determining how to allocate patterns.*\\n\\n### Updating Trip Searches\\n\\nChanging your model to reuse patterns instead of storing every stop time\\nmeans your data lookup routines must also be changed.\\n\\nFor example, to find all stop times for a given trip, you must now find\\nthe pattern using the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM patterns\\n  WHERE pattern_id = (SELECT pattern_id FROM trips WHERE trip_id = 'YOUR_TRIP_ID')\\n  ORDER BY stop_sequence;\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to determine the arrival/departure time, you must add the\\noffset stored for the pattern record to the starting time stored with\\nthe trip. This involves joining the tables and adding `time_offset` to\\n`start_time_secs`, as shown in the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.start_time_secs + p.time_offset, p.stop_id\\n  FROM patterns p, trips t\\n  WHERE p.pattern_id = t.pattern_id\\n  AND t.trip_id = 'YOUR_TRIP_ID'\\n  ORDER BY p.stop_sequence;\\n```\\n\\n### Other Data Reduction Methods\\n\\nThere are other ways you can reduce the amount of data, such as only\\nusing patterns to store the stops (and not timing offsets), and then\\nstoring the timings with each trip record. A technique such as this\\nfurther reduces the size of the database, but the trade-off is that\\nquerying the data becomes slightly more complex.\\n\\nHopefully you can see that by using the method described in this chapter\\nthere are a number of ways to be creative with GTFS data, and that you\\nmust make decisions when it comes to speed, size, and ease of querying\\ndata.\\n\",\n",

Introduction to GTFS\\n\\nGTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) is a data standard developed\\nby Google used to describe a public transportation system. Its primary\\npurpose was to enable public transit agencies to upload their schedules\\nto Google Transit so that users of Google Maps could easily figure out\\nwhich bus, train, ferry or otherwise to catch.\\n\\n> **A GTFS feed is a ZIP file that contains a series of CSV files that\\nlist routes, stops and trips in a public transportation system.**\\n\\nThis book examines GTFS in detail, including which data from a public\\ntransportation system can be represented, how to extract data, and\\nexplores some more advanced techniques for optimizing and querying data.\\n\\nThe official GTFS specification has been referenced a number of times in\\nthis book. It is strongly recommended you are familiar with it. You can\\nview at the following URL:\\n\\n<https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference>\\n\\n### Structure of a GTFS Feed\\n\\nA GTFS feed is a series of CSV files, which means that it is trivial to\\ninclude additional files in a feed. Additionally, files required as part\\nof the specification can also include additional columns. For this\\nreason, feeds from different agencies generally include different levels\\nof detail.\\n\\n***Note:** The files in a GTFS feed are CSV files, but use a file\\nextension of `.txt`.*\\n\\nA GTFS feed can be described as follows:\\n\\n> **A GTFS feed has one or more routes. Each route (`routes.txt`) has one or\\nmore trips (`trips.txt`). Each trip visits a series of stops (`stops.txt`)\\nat specified times (`stop_times.txt`). Trips and stop times only contain\\ntime of day information; the calendar is used to determine on which days\\na given trip runs (`calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt`).**\\n\\nThe following chapters cover the main files that are included in all\\nGTFS feeds. For each file, the main columns are covered, as well as\\noptional columns that can be included. This book also covers some of the\\nunofficial columns that some agencies choose to include.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 2. Agencies (agency.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nThe `agency.txt` file is used to represent the agencies that provide\\ndata for this feed. While its presence is optional, if there are routes\\nfrom multiple agencies included, then records in `routes.txt` make\\nreference to agencies in this file.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :-------- |\\n| `agency_id`                                            | Optional | An ID that uniquely identifies a single transit agency in the feed. If a feed only contains routes for a single agency then this value is optional. |\\n| `agency_name`                                          | Required | The full name of the transit agency. |\\n| `agency_url`                                           | Required | The URL of the transit agency. Must be a complete URL only, beginning with `http://` or `https://`. |\\n| `agency_timezone`                                      | Required | Time zone of agency. All times in `stop_times.txt` use this time zone, unless overridden by its corresponding stop. All agencies in a single feed must use the same time zone. Example: **America/New_York** (See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones> for more examples) |\\n| `agency_lang`                                          | Required | Contains a two-letter ISO-639-1 code (such as `en` or `EN` for English) for the language used in this feed. |\\n| `agency_phone`                                         | Optional | A single voice telephone number for the agency that users can dial if required. |\\n| `agency_fare_url`                                      | Optional | A URL that describes fare information for the agency. Must be a complete URL only, beginning with `http://` or `https://`. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following extract is taken from the GTFS feed of TriMet (Portland,\\nUSA), located at <https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>.\\n\\n| `agency_name` | `agency_url`                                 | `agency_timezone`     | `agency_lang` | `agency_phone`   |\\n| :------------ | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------ | :--------------- |\\n| `TriMet`      | `[https://trimets.org](https://trimet.org/)` | `America/Los_Angeles` | `en`          | `(503) 238-7433` | \\n\\nIn this example, the `agency_id` column is included, but as there is\\nonly a single entry the value can be empty. This means the `agency_id`\\ncolumn in `routes.txt` also is not required.\\n\\n### Discussion\\n\\nThe data in this file is typically used to provide additional\\ninformation to users of your app or web site in case schedules derived\\nfrom the rest of this feed are not sufficient (or in the case of\\n`agency_fare_url`, an easy way to provide a reference point to users\\nif the fare information in the feed is not being used).\\n\\nIf you refer to the following screenshot, taken from Google Maps, you\\ncan see the information from `agency.txt` represented in the\\nlower-left corner as an example of how it can be used.\\n\\n![GTFS agency](images/agency-google-maps.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3. Stops & Stations (stops.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nThe individual locations where vehicles pick up or drop off passengers\\nare represented by `stops.txt`. Records in this file are referenced in\\n`stop_times.txt`. A record in this file can be either a stop or a\\nstation. A station has one or more child stops, as indicated using the\\n`parent_station` value. Entries that are marked as stations may not\\nappear in `stop_times.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `stop_id` | Required | An ID to uniquely identify a stop or station. |\\n| `stop_code` | Optional | A number or short string used to identify a stop to passengers. This is typically displayed at the physical stop or on printed schedules. |\\n| `stop_name` | Required | The name of the stop as passengers know it by. |\\n| `stop_desc` | Optional | A description of the stop. If provided, this should provide additional information to the `stop_name` value. |\\n| `stop_lat` | Required | The latitude of the stop (a number in the range of `-90` to `90`). |\\n| `stop_lon` | Required | The longitude of the stop (a number in the range of `-180` to `180`). |\\n| `zone_id` | Optional | This is an identifier used to calculate fares. A single zone ID may appear in multiple stops, but is ignored if the stop is marked as a station. |\\n| `stop_url` | Optional | A URL that provides information about this stop. It should be specific to this stop and not simply link to the agency\\'s web site. |\\n| `location_type` | Optional | Indicates if a record is a stop or station. `0` or blank means a stop, `1` means a station. |\\n| `parent_station` | Optional | If a record is marked as a stop and has a parent station, this contains the ID of the parent (the parent must have a `location_type` of `1`). |\\n| `stop_timezone` | Optional | If a stop is located in a different time zone to the one specified in `agency.txt`, then it can be overridden here. |\\n| `wheelchair_boarding` | Optional | A value of `1` indicates it is possible for passengers in wheelchairs to board or alight. A value of `2` means the stop is not wheelchair accessible, while `0` or an empty value means no information is available. If the stop has a parent station, then 0 or an empty value means to inherit from its parent. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following extract is taken from the TriMet GTFS feed\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `stop_id` |  `stop_code` |  `stop_name`        | `stop_lat`  | `stop_lon`    | `stop_url`                                          |\\n| :-------- | :----------- | :------------------ | :---------- | :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------|\\n| `2`       | `2`          | `A Ave & Chandler`  | `45.420595` | `-122.675676` |` <http://trimet.org/arrivals/tracker?locationID=2>` |\\n| `3`       | `3`          | `A Ave & Second St` | `45.419386` | `-122.665341` |` <http://trimet.org/arrivals/tracker?locationID=3>` |\\n| `4`       | `4`          | `A Ave & 10th St`   | `45.420703` | `-122.675152` |` <http://trimet.org/arrivals/tracker?locationID=4>` |\\n| `6`       | `6`          | `A Ave & 8th St`    | `45.420217` | `-122.67307`  |` <http://trimet.org/arrivals/tracker?locationID=6>` |\\n\\nThe following diagram shows how these points look if you plot them onto\\na map.\\n\\n![Stops](images/stops-sample.png)\\n\\nIn this extract, TriMet use the same value for stop IDs and stop codes.\\nThis is useful, because it means the stop IDs are stable (that is, they\\ndo not change between feed versions). This means that if you want to\\nsave a particular stop (for instance, if a user wants to save a\\n\"favorite stop\") you can trust that saving the ID will get the job done.\\n\\n**Note:** This is not always the case though, which means you may have\\nto save additional information if you want to save a stop. For instance,\\nyou may need to save the coordinates or the list of routes a stop serves\\nso you can find it again if the stop ID has changed in a future version\\nof the feed.\\n\\n### Stops & Stations\\n\\nSpecifying an entry in this file as a *station* is typically used when\\nthere are many stops located within a single physical entity, such as a\\ntrain station or bus depot. While many feeds do not offer this\\ninformation, some large train stations may have up to 20 or 30\\nplatforms.\\n\\nKnowing the platform for a specific trip is extremely useful, but if a\\npassenger wants to select a starting point for their trip, showing them\\na list of platforms may be confusing.\\n\\nPassenger:\\n\\n**\"I want to travel from *Central Station* to *Airport Station*.\"**\\n\\nWeb site / App:\\n\\n**\"Board at *Central Station platform 5*, disembark at *Airport Station platform 1*.\"**\\n\\nIn this example, the passenger selects the parent station, but they are\\npresented with the specific stop so they know exactly where within the\\nstation they need to embark or disembark.\\n\\n### Wheelchair Accessibility\\n\\nIf you are showing wheelchair accessibility information, it is important\\nto differentiate between \"no access\" and \"no information\", as knowing a\\nstop is not accessible is as important as knowing it is.\\n\\nIf a stop is marked as being wheelchair accessible, you must check that\\ntrips that visit the stop are also accessible (using the\\n`wheelchair_accessible` field in `trips.txt`). If the value in\\n`trips.txt` is blank, `0` or `1` then it is safe to assume the\\ntrip can be accessed. If the stop is accessible and the trip is not,\\nthen passengers in wheelchairs cannot use the trip.\\n\\n### Stop Features\\n\\nOne of the proposed changes to GTFS is the addition of a file called\\n`stop_features.txt`. This is used to define characteristics about\\nstops. The great thing about this file is that it allows you to indicate\\nto users when a stop has a ticket machine, bike storage, lighting, or an\\nelectronic display with real-time information.\\n\\nTriMet is one of the few agencies including this file. The following is\\na sample of this file.\\n\\n| `stop_id` | `feature_type` |\\n| :-------- | :------------- |\\n| `61`      | `4110`         |\\n| `61`      | `2310`         |\\n| `61`      | `5200`         |\\n\\nThis data indicate that stop `61` (NE Alberta & 24th) has a *Printed\\nSchedule Display* (`4110`), a *Bike Rack* (`2310`) and a *Street\\nLight* (`5200`).\\n\\nFor more information about this proposal and a list of values and their\\nmeanings, refer to\\n<https://sites.google.com/site/gtfschanges/proposals/stop-amenity>.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4. Routes (routes.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nA route is a group of trips that are displayed to riders as a single\\nservice.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `route_id` | Required | An ID that uniquely identifies the route. |\\n| `agency_id` | Optional | The ID of the agency a route belongs to, as it appears in `agency.txt`. Only required if there are multiple agencies in the feed. |\\n| `route_short_name` | Required | A nickname or code to represent this service. If this is left empty then the `route_long_name` must be included. |\\n| `route_long_name` | Required | The route full name. If this is left empty then the `route_short_name` must be included. |\\n| `route_desc` | Optional | A description of the route, such as where and when the route operates. |\\n| `route_type` | Required | The type of transportation used on a route (such as bus, train or ferry). See below for more information. |\\n| `route_url` | Optional | A URL of a web page that describes this particular route. |\\n| `route_color` | Optional | If applicable, a route can have a color assigned to it. This is useful for systems that use colors to identify routes. This value is a six-character hexadecimal number (for example, `FF0000` is red). |\\n| `route_text_color` | Optional | For routes that specify the `route_color`, a corresponding text color should also be specified. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following extract is taken from the TriMet GTFS feed\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `route_id` | `route_short_name` | `route_long_name`            | `route_type` |\\n| :--------- | :----------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------- |\\n| `1`        | `1`                | `Vermont`                    | `3`          |\\n| `4`        | `4`                | `Division / Fessenden`       | `3`          |\\n| `6`        | `6`                | `Martin Luther King Jr Blvd` | `3`          |\\n\\nThis sample shows three different bus routes for the greater Portland\\narea. The `route_type` value of `3` indicates they are buses. See\\nthe next section for more information about route types in GTFS.\\n\\nThere is no agency ID value in this feed, as TriMet is the only agency\\nrepresented in the feed.\\n\\nThe other thing to note about this data is that TriMet use the same\\nvalue for both `route_id` and `route_short_name`. This is very\\nuseful, because it means if you have a user that wants to save\\ninformation about a particular route you can trust the `route_id`\\nvalue. Unfortunately, this is not the case in all GTFS feeds. Sometimes,\\nthe `route_id` value may change with every version of a feed (or at\\nleast, semi-frequently). Additionally, some feeds may also have multiple\\nroutes with the same `route_short_name`. This can present challenges\\nwhen trying to save user data.\\n\\n### Route Types\\n\\nTo indicate a route\\'s mode of transport, the `route_type` column is\\nused.\\n\\n| Value | Description       |\\n| :---- | :---------------- |\\n| `0`   | Tram / Light Rail |\\n| `1`   | Subway / Metro    |\\n| `2`   | Rail              |\\n| `3`   | Bus               |\\n| `4`   | Ferry             |\\n| `5`   | Cable Car         |\\n| `6`   | Gondola           |  \\n| `7`   | Funicular         |\\n\\nAgencies may interpret the meaning of these route types differently. For\\ninstance, some agencies specify their subway service as rail (value of\\n`2` instead of `1`), while some specify their trains as light rail\\n(`0` instead of `2`).\\n\\nThese differences between agencies occur mainly because of the vague\\ndescriptions for each of these route types. If you use Google Transit to\\nfind directions, you may notice route types referenced that are\\ndifferent to those listed above. This is because Google Transit also\\nsupports additional route types. You can read more about these\\nadditional route types at\\n<https://support.google.com/transitpartners/answer/3520902?hl=en>.\\n\\nVery few GTFS feeds made available to third-party developers actually\\nmake use of these values, but it is useful to know in case you come\\nacross one that does. For instance, Sydney Buses include their school\\nbuses with a route type of `712`, while other buses in the feed have\\nroute type `700`.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5. Trips (trips.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nThe `trips.txt` file contains trips for each route. The specific stop\\ntimes are specified in `stop_times.txt`, and the days each trip runs\\non are specified in `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `route_id` | Required | The ID of the route a trip belongs to as it appears in `routes.txt`. |\\n| `service_id` | Required | The ID of the service as it appears in `calendar.txt` or `calendar_dates.txt`, which identifies the dates on which a trip runs. |\\n| `trip_id` | Required | A unique identifier for a trip in this file. This value is referenced in `stop_times.txt` when specifying individual stop times. |\\n| `trip_headsign` | Optional | The text that appears to passengers as the destination or description of the trip. Mid-trip changes to the headsign can be specified in `stop_times.txt`. |\\n| `trip_short_name` | Optional | A short name or code to identify the particular trip, different to the route\\'s short name. This may identify a particular train number or a route variation. |\\n| `direction_id` | Optional | Indicates the direction of travel for a trip, such as to differentiate between an inbound and an outbound trip. |\\n| `block_id` | Optional | A block is a series of trips conducted by the same vehicle. This ID is used to group 2 or more trips together. |\\n| `shape_id` | Optional | This value references a value from `shapes.txt` to define a shape for a trip. |\\n| `wheelchair_accessible` | Optional | `0` or blank indicates unknown, while `1` indicates the vehicle can accommodate at least one wheelchair passenger. A value of `2` indicates no wheelchairs can be accommodated. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nConsider the following extract, taken from the `trips.txt` file of the\\nTriMet GTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `route_id` | `service_id` | `trip_id`   | `direction_id` | `block_id` | `shape_id` |\\n| ---------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282257     | 0              | 103        | 185327     |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282256     | 0              | 101        | 185327     |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282255     | 0              | 102        | 185327     |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282254     | 0              | 103        | 185327     |\\n\\nThis data describes four individual trips for the \"Vermont\" bus route\\n(this was determined by looking up the `route_id` value in\\n`routes.txt`). While the values for `trip_id`, `block_id` and\\n`shape_id` are all integers in this particular instance, this is not a\\nrequirement. Just like `service_id`, there may be non-numeric\\ncharacters.\\n\\nAs each of these trips is for the same route and runs in the same\\ndirection (based on `direction_id`) they can all be represented by the\\nsame shape. Note however that this is not always be the case as some\\nagencies may start or finish trips for a single route at different\\nlocations depending on the time of the day. If this were the case, then\\nthe trip\\'s shape would differ slightly (and therefore have a different\\nshape to represent it in `shapes.txt`).\\n\\nAlthough this example does not include `trip_headsign`, many feeds do\\ninclude this value. This is useful for indicating to a passenger where\\nthe trip is headed. When the trip headsign is not provided in the feed,\\nyou can determine the destination by using the final stop in a trip.\\n\\n**Tip:** If you are determining the destination based on the final stop,\\nyou can either present the stop name to the user, or you can\\nreverse-geocode the stop\\'s coordinates to determine the its locality.\\n\\n### Blocks\\n\\nIn the preceding example, each trip has a value for `block_id`. The\\nfirst and the last trips here both have a `block_id` value of `103`.\\nThis indicates that the same physical vehicle completes both of these\\ntrips. As each of these trips go in the same direction, it is likely\\nthat they start at the same location.\\n\\nThis means there is probably another trip in the feed for the same block\\nthat exists between the trips listed here. It would likely travel from\\nthe finishing point of the first trip (`4282257`) to the starting\\npoint of the other trip (`4282254`). If you dig a little deeper in the\\nfeed you will find the trip shown in the following table.\\n\\n| `route_id` | `service_id` | `trip_id` | `direction_id` | `block_id` | `shape_id` |\\n| :--------- | :----------- | :-------- | :------------- | :--------- | :--------- |\\n| 1          | W.378        | 4282270   | 1              | 103        | 185330     |\\n\\nThis is a trip traveling in the opposite direction for the same block.\\nIt has a different shape ID because it is traveling in the opposite\\ndirection; a shape\\'s points must advance in the same direction a trip\\'s\\nstop times do.\\n\\n***Note:** You should perform some validation when grouping trips\\ntogether using block IDs. For instance, if trips share a block_id value\\nthen they should also have the same service_id value. You should also\\ncheck that the times do not overlap; otherwise the same vehicle would be\\nunable to service both trips.*\\n\\nIf you dig even further in this feed, there are actually seven different\\ntrips all using block `103` for the **W.378** service period. This\\nroughly represents a full day\\'s work for a single vehicle.\\n\\nFor more discussion on blocks and how to utilize them effectively, refer\\nto *Working With Trip Blocks*.\\n\\n### Wheelchair Accessibility\\n\\nSimilar to `stops.txt`, you can specify the wheelchair accessibility\\nof a specific trip using the `wheelchair_accessible` field. While many\\nfeeds do not provide this information (often because vehicles in a fleet\\ncan be changed at the last minute, so agencies do not want to guarantee\\nthis information), your wheelchair-bound users will love you if you can\\nprovide this information.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the section on `stops.txt`, it is equally important to\\ntell a user that a specific vehicle cannot accommodate wheelchairs as to\\nwhen it can. Additionally, if the stops in a feed also have wheelchair\\ninformation, then both the stop and trip must be wheelchair accessible\\nfor a passenger to be able to access a trip at the given stop.\\n\\n### Trip Direction\\n\\nOne of the optional fields in `trips.txt` is `direction_id`, which\\nis used to indicate the general direction a vehicle is traveling. At\\npresent the only possible values are `0` to represent \"inbound\" and\\n`1` to represent \"outbound\". There are no specific guidelines as to\\nwhat each value means, but the intention is that an inbound trip on a\\nparticular route should be traveling in the opposite direction to an\\noutbound trip.\\n\\nMany GTFS feeds do not provide this information. In fact, there are a\\nhandful of feeds that include two entries in `routes.txt` for each\\nroute (one for each direction).\\n\\nOne of the drawbacks of `direction_id` is that there are many routes\\nfor which \"inbound\" or \"outbound\" do not actually mean anything. Many\\ncities have loop services that start and finish each trip at the same\\nlocation. Some cities have one or more loops that travel in both\\ndirections (generally indicated by \"clockwise loop\" and\\n\"counter-clockwise loop\", or words to that effect). In these instances,\\nthe `direction_id` can be used to determine which direction the route\\nis traveling.\\n\\n### Trip Short Name\\n\\nThe `trip_short_name` field that appears in `trips.txt` is used to\\nprovide a vehicle-specific code to a particular trip on a route. Based\\non GTFS feeds that are currently in publication, it appears there are\\ntwo primary use-cases for this field:\\n\\n* Specifying a particular train number for all trains on a route\\n* Specifying a route \"sub-code\" for a route variant.\\n\\n### Specifying a Train Number\\n\\nFor certain commuter rail systems, such as SEPTA in Philadelphia or MBTA\\nin Boston, each train has a specific number associated with it. This\\nnumber is particularly meaningful to passengers as trains on the same\\nroute may have different stopping patterns or even different features\\n(for instance, only a certain train may have air-conditioning or\\nwheelchair access).\\n\\nConsider the following extract from SEPTA\\'s rail feed\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/septa>).\\n\\n| `route_id` | `service_id` | `trip_id`    | `trip_headsign`          | `block_id` | `trip_short_name` |\\n| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |\\n| AIR        | S5           | AIR_1404_V25 | Center City Philadelphia | 1404       | 1404              |\\n| AIR        | S1           | AIR_402_V5   | Center City Philadelphia | 402        | 402               |\\n| AIR        | S1           | AIR_404_V5   | Center City Philadelphia | 404        | 404               |\\n| AIR        | S5           | AIR_406_V25  | Center City Philadelphia | 406        | 406               |\\n\\nIn this data, there are four different trains all heading to the same\\ndestination. The `trip_short_name` is a value that can safely be\\npresented to users as it has meaning to them. In this case, you could\\npresent the first trip to passengers as:\\n\\n**\"Train 1404 on the Airport line heading to Center City\\nPhiladelphia.\"**\\n\\nIn this particular feed, SEPTA use the same value for\\n`trip_short_name` and for `block_id`, because the train number\\nbelongs to a specific train. This means after it completes the trip to\\nCenter City Philadelphia it continues on. In this particular feed, the\\nfollowing trip also exists:\\n\\n**\"Train 1404 on the Warminster line heading to Glenside.\"**\\n\\nYou can therefore think of the `trip_short_name` value as a\\n\"user-facing\" version of `block_id`.\\n\\n### Specifying a Route Sub-Code\\n\\nThe other use-case for `trip_short_name` is for specifying a route\\nsub-code. For instance, consider an agency that has a route with short\\nname `100` that travels from stop `S1` to stop `S2`. At night the\\nagency only has a limited number of routes running, so they extend this\\nroute to also visit stop `S3` (so it travels from `S1` to `S2`\\nthen to `S3`). As it is a minor variation of the main path, the agency\\ncalls this trip `100A`.\\n\\nThe agency could either create a completely separate entry in\\n`routes.txt` (so they would have `100` and `100A`), or they can\\noverride the handful of trips in the evening by setting the\\n`trip_short_name` to `100A`. The following table shows how this\\nexample might be represented.\\n\\n| `route_id` | `trip_id` | `service_id` | `trip_short_name` |\\n| ---------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------------- |\\n| 100        | T1        | C1           |                   |\\n| 100        | T2        | C1           |                   |\\n| 100        | T3        | C1           |                   |\\n| 100        | T4        | C1           | 100A              |\\n\\nIn this example the `trip_short_name` does not need to be set for the\\nfirst three trips as they use the `route_short_name` value from\\n`routes.txt`.\\n\\n### Specifying Bicycle Permissions\\n\\nA common field that appears in many GTFS fields is\\n`trip_bikes_allowed`, which is used to indicate whether or not\\npassengers are allowed to take bicycles on board. This is useful for\\nautomated trip planning when bicycle options can be included in the\\nresults.\\n\\nThe way this field works is similar to the wheelchair information; `0`\\nor empty means no information provided; `1` means no bikes allowed;\\nwhile `2` means at least one bike can be accommodated.\\n\\n**Note:** Unfortunately, this value is backwards when you compare it to\\nwheelchair accessibility fields. For more discussion on this matter,\\nrefer to the topic on the Google Group for GTFS Changes\\n(<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/gtfs-changes/rEiSeKNc4cs/discussion>).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 6. Stop Times (stop_times.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***required*** to be included in GTFS feeds.*\\n\\nThe `stop_times.txt` file specifies individual stop arrivals and\\ndepartures for each trip. This file is typically the largest in a GTFS\\nfeed as it contains many records that correspond to each entry in\\n`trips.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `trip_id` | Required | References a trip from `trips.txt`. This ID is referenced for every stop in a trip. |\\n| `arrival_time` | Required | The arrival time in `HH:MM:SS` format. Can be left blank, except for at least the first and last stop time in a trip. This value is typically be the same as `departure_time`. |\\n| `departure_time` | Required | The departure time in `HH:MM:SS` format. Can be left blank, except for at least the first and last stop time in a trip. This value is typically be the same as `arrival_time`. |\\n| `stop_id` | Required | References a single stop from `stops.txt`. |\\n| `stop_sequence` | Required | A unique number for a given trip to indicate the stopping order. Typically these values appear in order and increment by 1 for each stop time, but this is not always the case. |\\n| `stop_headsign` | Optional | This is text that appears to passengers at this stop to identify the trip\\'s destination. It should only be used to override the `trip_headsign` value from `trips.txt`. |\\n| `pickup_type` | Optional | Indicates if passengers can be picked up at this stop. Sometimes a stop is drop-off only. |\\n| `drop_off_type` | Optional | Indicates if passengers can be dropped off at this stop. Sometimes a stop is pick-up only. |\\n| `shape_dist_traveled` | Optional | If a trip has an associated shape, this value indicates how far along that shape the vehicle has traveled when at this stop. Values in this file and `shapes.txt` must use the same unit. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nConsider the following extract, taken from stop_times.txt in the TriMet\\nGTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>). This represents the\\nfirst ten stops of a trip for bus route `1` (\"Vermont\") in Portland, as\\ncovered in Sample Data for `trips.txt`.\\n\\n| `trip_id` | `arrival_time` | `departure_time` | `stop_id` | `stop_sequence` | `shape_dist_traveled` |\\n| :-------- | :------------- | :--------------- | :-------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- |\\n| 4282247   | 06:47:00       | 06:47:00         | 13170     | 1               | 0.0                   |\\n| 4282247   | 06:48:18       | 06:48:18         | 7631      | 2               | 867.5                 |\\n| 4282247   | 06:50:13       | 06:50:13         | 7625      | 3               | 2154.9                |\\n| 4282247   | 06:52:07       | 06:52:07         | 7612      | 4               | 3425.5                |\\n| 4282247   | 06:53:42       | 06:53:42         | 7616      | 5               | 4491.1                |\\n| 4282247   | 06:55:16       | 06:55:16         | 10491     | 6               | 5536.2                |\\n| 4282247   | 06:57:06       | 06:57:06         | 7588      | 7               | 6767.1                |\\n| 4282247   | 06:58:00       | 06:58:00         | 7591      | 8               | 7364.4                |\\n| 4282247   | 06:58:32       | 06:58:32         | 175       | 9               | 8618.7                |\\n| 4282247   | 06:58:50       | 06:58:50         | 198       | 10              | 9283.8                |\\n\\nIf you were to plot the full trip on a map (including using its shape\\nfile, as specified in `shapes.txt` and referenced in `trips.txt`),\\nit would look like the following diagram. The first stop is selected.\\n\\n![Stop Times](images/stop-times.png)\\n\\n### Arrival Time vs. Departure Time\\n\\nThe first thing to notice about this data is that the values in\\n`arrival_time` and `departure_time` are the same. In reality, most\\nof the time these values are the same. The situation where these values\\ndiffer is typically when a vehicle is required to wait for a period of\\ntime before departing. For instance:\\n\\n**\"The train departs the domestic airport at 6:30am, arrives at the\\ninternational terminal at 6:35am. It waits for 10 minutes for passengers\\nwho have just landed to board, then departs for the city at 6:45am.\"**\\n\\nWhile this is not typically something you need to worry about, be aware\\nthat some feeds differ and the holdover time could be large. A person\\nrushing to a train wants to know the time it departs, while a husband\\nwaiting at a stop to meet his wife wants to know what time it arrives.\\n\\n**Note:** In a situation where the difference between the arrival time\\nand departure is small, you may be better off always displaying the\\nearlier time to the user. The driver may view a one or two minute\\nholdover as an opportunity to keep on time, whereas a ten or fifteen\\nminute holdover is unlikely to be ignored as doing so would\\nsignificantly alter the schedule.\\n\\n### Scheduling Past Midnight\\n\\nOne of the most important concepts to understand about\\n`stop_times.txt` is that times later than midnight can be specified.\\nFor example, if a trip starts at 11:45 PM and takes an hour to complete,\\nits finishing time is 12:45 AM the next day.\\n\\nThe `departure_time` value for the first stop is be `23:45:00`,\\nwhile the `arrival_time` value for the final stop is `24:45:00`.\\nIf you were to specify the final arrival time as `00:45:00`, it\\nwould be referencing 12:45 AM prior to the trip\\'s starting time.\\n\\nWhile you could use the `stop_sequence` to determine which day the\\ntrip fell on, it would be impossible to do a quick search purely based\\non the given final stop.\\n\\nA trip may start and finish after midnight without being considered as\\npart of the next day\\'s service. Many transit systems shut down\\novernight, but may have a few services that run after midnight until\\nabout 1 AM or 2 AM. It is logical to group them all together with the\\nsame service as earlier trips, which this functionality allows you to\\ndo.\\n\\nHowever, this has implications when searching for trips. For instance,\\nif you want to find all trips between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM on 30 January\\n2014, then you need to search:\\n\\n* Between `00:00:00` and `01:00:00` for trips with service on `20140130`\\n* Between `24:00:00` and `25:00:00` for trips with service on` 20140129`\\n\\nIn *Searching for Trips* you can see how to apply this to your\\ntrip searches.\\n\\n### Time Points\\n\\nMost GTFS feeds provide arrival/departure times for every single stop.\\nIn reality, most agencies do not have known times (or at least, they do\\nnot publish times) for many of their stops.\\n\\nTypically, for routes that describe trains, subways or ferries that make\\nrelatively few stops in a trip, all stops have a specified time.\\nHowever, often for bus routes that may make many stops in a single trip,\\ngenerally only the main stops have times shown on printed schedules.\\n\\nTypically, the bus drivers are required to meet these time points; if\\nthey are ahead of schedule they might wait at a time point until the\\nscheduled time; if they are running late they might try to catch up in\\norder to adhere to the specified time point.\\n\\nThis means that the intermediate points are likely estimates that have\\nbeen interpolated based on the amount of time between time points. If\\nthere are multiple stops in-between the time points then the distance\\nbetween stops may also be used to calculate the estimate.\\n\\nIn actual fact, GTFS feeds do not have to specify times for all stops.\\nThe data in the following table is perfectly valid for a trip.\\n\\n| `trip_id` | `arrival_time` | `stop_id` | `stop_sequence` | `shape_dist_traveled` |\\n| :-------- | :------------- | :-------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- |\\n| T1        | 10:00:00       | S1        | 1               | 0                     |\\n| T1        |                | S2        | 2               | 1500                  |\\n| T1        |                | S3        | 3               | 3000                  |\\n| T1        | 10:12:00       | S4        | 4               | 6000                  |\\n\\nBased on this data, without taking into account the distance traveled,\\nyou may estimate that the second stop arrives at 10:04 AM while the\\nthird stop arrives at 10:08.\\n\\nIf you consider the distance traveled, you might conclude the second\\nstop arrives at 10:03 AM while the third stop arrives at 10:06 AM.\\n\\nSome agencies include an additional column in `stop_times.txt` called\\n`timepoint`. This is used when they specify the times for all stops\\nbut also want to indicate if only certain stops are guaranteed times.\\n\\nThe following table shows how this would look using the previous data as\\nits basis.\\n\\n|  `trip_id` | `arrival_time` | `stop_id` | `stop_sequence` | `shape_dist_traveled` | `timepoint` |\\n| :--------- | :------------- | :-------- | :-------------- | :-------------------- | :---------- |\\n|  T1        | 10:00:00       | S1        | 1               | 0                     | 1           |\\n|  T1        | 10:03:00       | S2        | 2               | 1500                  | 0           |\\n|  T1        | 10:06:00       | S3        | 3               | 3000                  | 0           |\\n|  T1        | 10:12:00       | S4        | 4               | 6000                  | 1           |\\n\\nThis can be especially useful if you want to highlight these time points\\nso as to represent the printed schedules accurately, or even if you are\\na transit agency just using the data for internal reporting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 7. Trip Schedules (calendar.txt & calendar_dates.txt)\\n\\n*Each of these files are ***optional*** in a GTFS feed, but at least one\\nof them is ***required***.*\\n\\nThe `calendar.txt` file is used to indicate the range of dates on\\nwhich trips are running. It works by including a start date and a finish\\ndate (typically a range of 3-6 months), then a marker for each day of\\nthe week on which it operates. If there are single-day scheduling\\nchanges that occur during this period, then the `calendar_dates.txt`\\nfile can be used to override the schedule for each of these days.\\n\\nThe following table shows the specification for `calendar.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `service_id` | Required | A unique ID for a single service. This value is referenced by trips in `trips.txt`. |\\n| `start_date` | Required | This indicates the start date for a given service, in `YYYYMMDD` format. |\\n| `end_date` | Required | This indicates the end date for a given service, in `YYYYMMDD` format. |\\n| `monday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Mondays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `tuesday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Tuesdays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `wednesday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Wednesdays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `thursday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Thursdays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `friday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Fridays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `saturday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Saturdays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n| `sunday` | Required | Contains `1` if trips run on Sundays between the start and end dates, `0` or empty if not. |\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the `calendar_dates.txt` file is used to define\\nexceptions to entries in `calendar.txt`. For instance, if a 3-month\\nservice is specified in `calendar.txt` and a holiday lies on a Monday\\nduring this period, then you can use calendar_dates.txt to override this\\nsingle date.\\n\\nIf the weekend schedule were used for a holiday, then you would add a\\nrecord to remove the regular schedule for the holiday date, and another\\nrecord to add the weekend schedule for the holiday date.\\n\\nSome feeds choose only to include `calendar_dates.txt` and not\\n`calendar.txt`, in which case there is an \"add service\" record for\\nevery service and every date in this file.\\n\\nThe following table shows the specification for `calendar_dates.txt`.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `service_id` | Required | The service ID that an exception is being defined for. This is referenced in both `calendar.txt` and in `trips.txt`. Unlike `calendar.txt`, it is possible for a `service_id` value to appear multiple times in this file. |\\n| `date` | Required | The date for which the exception is occurring, in `YYYYMMDD` format. |\\n| `exception_type` | Required | This indicates whether the exception is denoting an added service (`1`) or a removed service (`2`). |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following is an extract from the `calendar.txt` file in Adelaide\\nMetro\\'s GTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/adelaide-metro>). This\\nextract includes schedules from the start of 2014 until the end of March\\n2014.\\n\\n| `service_id` | `monday` | `tuesday` | `wednesday` | `thursday` | `friday` | `saturday` | `sunday` | `start_date` | `end_date` |\\n| :----------- | :------- | :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------- | :--------- | :------- | :----------- | :--------- |\\n| 1            | 1        | 1         | 1           | 1          | 1        | 0          | 0        | 20140102     | 20140331   |\\n| 11           | 0        | 0         | 0           | 0          | 0        | 1          | 0        | 20140102     | 20140331   |\\n| 12           | 0        | 0         | 0           | 0          | 0        | 0          | 1        | 20140102     | 20140331   |\\n\\nAny trip in the corresponding `trips.txt` file with a `service_id`\\nvalue of `1` runs from Monday to Friday. Trips with a `service_id`\\nof `11` run only on Saturday, while those with `12` run only on\\nSunday.\\n\\nNow consider an extract from `calendar_dates.txt` from the same feed,\\nas shown in the following table.\\n\\n| `service_id` | `date`   | `exception_type` |\\n| ------------ | -------- | ---------------- |\\n| 1            | 20140127 | 2                |\\n| 1            | 20140310 | 2                |\\n| 12           | 20140127 | 1                |\\n| 12           | 20140310 | 1                |\\n\\nThe first two rows mean that on January 27 and March 10 trips with\\n`service_id` of `1` are not running. The final two rows mean that on\\nthose same dates trips with `service_id` of `12` are running. This\\nhas the following meaning:\\n\\n**\"On 27 January and 10 March, use the Sunday timetable instead of the\\nMonday-Friday timetable.\"**\\n\\nIn Adelaide, these two dates are holidays (Australia Day and Labour\\nDay). It is Adelaide Metro\\'s policy to run their Sunday timetable on\\npublic holidays, which is reflected by the above records in their\\n`calendar_dates.txt` file.\\n\\n### Structuring Services\\n\\nThe case described above is the ideal case for specifying services in a\\nGTFS feed (dates primarily specified in `calendar.txt` with a handful\\nof exceptions in `calendar_dates.txt`).\\n\\nBe aware that there are two other major ways that services are specified\\nin feeds.\\n\\n1.  Using only `calendar_dates.txt` and expressly including every\\n    single date within the service range. Each of these is included as\\n    \"service added\" (an `exception_type` value of `1`). The\\n    following table shows how this might look.\\n\\n| `service_id` | `date`   | `exception_type` |\\n| :----------- | :------- | :--------------- |\\n|  1           | 20140102 | 1                |\\n|  1           | 20140103 | 1                |\\n|  11          | 20140104 | 1                |\\n|  12          | 20140105 | 1                |\\n\\n2.  Not using `calendar_dates.txt`, but creating many records in\\n    `calendar.txt` instead to span various dates. The following table\\n    shows how you can represent Monday-Friday from the sample data in\\n    this fashion.\\n\\n| `service_id` | `monday` | `tuesday` | `wednesday` | `thursday` | `friday` | `saturday` | `sunday` | `start_date` | `end_date` |\\n| :----------- | :------- | :-------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------- | :--------- | :------- | :----------- | :--------- |\\n| 1a           | 1        | 1         | 1           | 1          | 1        | 0          | 0        | 20140102     | 20140126   |\\n| holiday1     | 1        | 0         | 0           | 0          | 0        | 0          | 0        | 20140127     | 20140127   |\\n| 1b           | 1        | 1         | 1           | 1          | 1        | 0          | 0        | 20140128     | 20140309   |\\n| holiday2     | 1        | 0         | 0           | 0          | 0        | 0          | 0        | 20140310     | 20140310   |\\n| 1c           | 1        | 1         | 1           | 1          | 1        | 0          | 0        | 20140311     | 20140331   |\\n\\nIn this example, each holiday has its own row in `calendar.txt` that\\nruns for a single day only.\\n\\nRefer to *Finding Service IDs* to see how to determine\\nservices that are running for a given day.\\n\\n### Service Name\\n\\nThere are a number of feeds that specify a column in `calendar.txt`\\ncalled `service_name`. This is used to give a descriptive name to each\\nservice. For example, the Sedona Roadrunner in Arizona\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/sedona-roadrunner>) has services called\\n\"Weekday Service\", \"Weekend Service\" and \"New Year\\'s Eve Service\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 8. Fare Definitions (fare_attributes.txt & fare_rules.txt)\\n\\n*These files are ***optional*** in a GTFS feed, but any rules specified\\nmust reference a fare attributes record.*\\n\\nThese two files define the types of fares that exist in a system,\\nincluding their price and transfer information. The attributes of a\\nparticular fare exist in `fare_attributes.txt`, which has the\\nfollowing columns.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `fare_id` | Required | A value that uniquely identifies a fare listed in this file. It must only appear once in this file. |\\n| `price` | Required | This field specifies the cost of the fare. For instance, if a trip costs $2 USD, then this value should be either `2.00` or `2`, and the `currency_type` should be `USD`. |\\n| `currency_type` | Required | This is the currency code that `price` is specified in, such as USD for United States Dollar. |\\n| `payment_method` | Required | This indicates when the fare is to be paid. `0` means it can be paid on board, while `1` means it must be paid before boarding. |\\n| `transfers` | Required | The number of transfers that may occur. This must either be empty (unlimited) transfers, or the number of transfers. |\\n| `transfer_duration` | Optional | This is the number of seconds a transfer is valid for. |\\n\\nThe following table shows the specification for `fare_rules.txt`,\\nwhich defines the rules used to apply a fare to a particular trip.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `fare_id` | Required | This is the ID of the fare that a rule applies to as it appears in `fare_attributes.txt`. |\\n| `route_id` | Optional | The ID of a route as it appears in `routes.txt` for which this rule applies. If there are several routes with the same fare attributes, there may be a row in `fare_rules.txt` for each route. |\\n| `origin_id` | Optional | This value corresponds to a `zone_id` value from `stops.txt`. If specified, this means a trip must begin in the given zone in order to qualify for this fare. |\\n| `destination_id` | Optional | This value corresponds to a `zone_id` value from `stops.txt`. If specified, this means a trip must begin in the given zone in order to qualify for this fare. |\\n| `contains_id` | Optional | This value corresponds to a `zone_id` value from `stops.txt`. If specified, this means a trip must pass through every `contains_id` zone for the given fare (in other words, several rules may need to be checked). |\\n\\nNote that aside from `fare_id`, all fields are optional in this file.\\nThis means some very complex rules can be made (especially when\\ntransfers come into the calculation). The following URL has discussion\\nabout different rules and some complex fare examples:\\n\\n<https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/FareExamples>\\n\\nRefer to *Calculating Fares* for discussion about the\\nalgorithm for calculating fares for trips both with and without\\ntransfers.\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following data is taken from the TriMet GTFS feed\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).

In this particular feed, bus stops\\nhave a `zone_id` of `B`, while rail stops have `R`.\\n\\nThe fares in this file are as follows:\\n\\n* Fare `B`. If you start at a bus stop (`zone_id` value of `B`),\\n  you can buy your ticket on board (`payment_method` of `0`). You\\n  may transfer an unlimited number (empty transfers value) for 2 hours\\n  (`transfer_duration` of `7200`). The cost is $2.50 USD.\\n* Fare `R`. If you start at a rail stop, you must pre-purchase your\\n  ticket. You may transfer an unlimited number of times to other rail\\n  services for up to 2 hours. The cost is $2.50 USD.\\n\\nThe `BR` fare describes a trip that begins on a bus then transfers to\\na rail service (while `RB` is the opposite). This fare is not be\\nmatched if the passenger does not travel on both, as all `contains_id`\\nvalues must be matched in order to apply a fare.\\n\\nThe other fares (`SC`, `AT` and `VT`) all apply to their\\nrespective `route_id` values, regardless of start and finish stops.\\nTickets must be pre-purchased, and transfers are not allowed. The `VT`\\nfare (which corresponds to TriMet\\'s Vintage Trolley) is free to ride\\nsince it has a price of `0`.\\n\\n### Assigning Fares to Agencies\\n\\nOne of the extensions available to `fare_attributes.txt` is to include\\nan `agency_id` column. This is to limit a specific fare to only routes\\nfrom the specified agency, in the case where a feed has multiple\\nagencies.\\n\\nThis is useful because there may be two agencies in a feed that define\\nfares with no specific rules (in other words, the fare applies to all\\ntrips). If the price differs, then GTFS dictates that the cheapest fare\\nis always applied. Using `agency_id` means these fares can be\\ndifferentiated accordingly.\\n\\nFor more information about this extension, refer to the Google Transit\\nGTFS Extensions page at\\n<https://support.google.com/transitpartners/answer/2450962>.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 9. Trip Shapes (shapes.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***optional*** in a GTFS feed.*\\n\\nEach trip in `trips.txt` can have a shape associated with it. The\\nshapes.txt file defines the points that make up an individual shape in\\norder to plot a trip on a map. Two or more records in `shapes.txt`\\nwith the same `shape_id` value define a shape.\\n\\nThe amount of data stored in this file can be quite large. In\\n*Optimizing Shapes* there are some strategies to efficiently\\nreduce the amount of shape data.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `shape_id` | Required | An ID to uniquely identify a shape. Every point for a shape contains the same value. |\\n| `shape_pt_lat` | Required | The latitude for a given point in the range of `-90` to `90`. |\\n| `shape_pt_lon` | Required | The longitude for a given point in the range of `-180` to `180`. |\\n| `shape_pt_sequence` | Required | A non-negative number that defines the ordering for points in a shape. A value must not be repeated within a single shape. |\\n| `shape_dist_traveled` | Optional | This value represents how far along a shape a particular point exists. This is a distance in a unit such as feet or kilometers. This unit must be the same as that used in `stop_times.txt`. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following table shows a portion of a shape from the TriMet GTFS\\nfeed. It is a portion of the shape that corresponds to the sample data\\nin the `stop_times.txt` section.\\n\\n| `shape_id` | `shape_pt_lat` | `shape_pt_lon` | `shape_pt_sequence` | `shape_dist_traveled` |\\n| :--------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------- |\\n| 185328     | 45.52291       | -122.677372    | 1                   | 0.0                   |\\n| 185328     | 45.522921      | -122.67737     | 2                   | 3.7                   |\\n| 185328     | 45.522991      | -122.677432    | 3                   | 34.0                  |\\n| 185328     | 45.522992      | -122.677246    | 4                   | 81.5                  |\\n| 185328     | 45.523002      | -122.676567    | 5                   | 255.7                 |\\n| 185328     | 45.523004      | -122.676486    | 6                   | 276.4                 |\\n| 185328     | 45.523007      | -122.676386    | 7                   | 302.0                 |\\n| 185328     | 45.523024      | -122.675386    | 8                   | 558.4                 |\\n| 185328     | 45.522962      | -122.67538     | 9                   | 581.0                 |\\n\\nIn this sample data, the `shape_dist_traveled` is listed in feet.\\nThere is no way to specify in a GTFS feed which units are used for this\\ncolumn -- it could be feet, miles, meters, kilometers. In actual fact,\\nit does not really matter, just as long as the units are the same as in\\n`stop_times.txt`.\\n\\nIf you need to present a distance to your users (such as how far you\\nneed to travel on a bus), you can calculate it instead by adding up the\\ndistance between each point and formatting it based on the user\\'s\\nlocale settings.\\n\\n### Point Sequences\\n\\nIn most GTFS feeds the `shape_pt_sequence` value starts at 1 and\\nincrements by 1 for every subsequent point. Additionally, points are\\ntypically listed in order of their sequence.\\n\\nYou should not rely on these two statements though, as this is not a\\nrequirement of GTFS. Many transit agencies have automated systems that\\nexport their GTFS from a separate system, which can sometimes result in\\nan unpredictable output format.\\n\\nFor instance, a trip that has stop times listed with the sequences `1`, `2`,\\n`9`, `18`, `7`, `3` is perfectly valid.\\n\\n### Distance Travelled\\n\\nThe `shape_dist_traveled` column is used so you can programmatically\\ndetermine how much of a shape to draw when showing a map to users of\\nyour web site or app. If you use techniques in *Optimizing Shapes*\\nto reduce the file size of shape data, then it becomes difficult to\\nuse this value.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can calculate portions of shapes by determining which\\npoint in a shape travels closest to the start and finish points of a\\ntrip.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 10. Repeating Trips (frequencies.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***optional*** in a GTFS feed.*\\n\\nIn some cases a route may repeat a particular stopping pattern every few\\nminutes (picture a subway line that runs every 5 minutes). Rather than\\nincluding entries in `trips.txt` and `stop_times.txt` for every\\nsingle occurrence, you can include the trip once then define rules for\\nit to repeat for a period of time.\\n\\nHaving a trip repeat only works in the case where the timing between\\nstops remains consistent for all stops. Using `frequencies.txt`, you\\nuse the relative times between stops alongside a calculated starting\\ntime for the trip in order to determine the specific stop times.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `trip_id` | Required | The ID of the trip as it appears in `trips.txt` that is being repeated. A single trip can appear multiple times for different time ranges. |\\n| `start_time` | Required | The time at which a given trip starts repeating, in `HH:MM:SS` format. |\\n| `end_time` | Required | The time at which a given trip stops repeating, in `HH:MM:SS` format. |\\n| `headway_secs` | Required | The time in seconds between departures from a given stop during the time range. |\\n| `exact_times` | Optional | Whether or not repeating trips should be exactly scheduled. See below for discussion. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following sample data is taken from Société de transport de Montréal\\n(STM) in Montreal\\n(<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/societe-de-transport-de-montreal>).\\n\\n| `trip_id`                | `start_time` | `end_time` | `headway_secs` |\\n| :----------------------- | :----------- | :--------- | :------------- |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_2_0.26528   | 05:30:00     | 07:25:30   | 630            |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_6_0.34167   | 07:25:30     | 08:40:10   | 560            |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_10_0.42500  | 08:40:10     | 12:19:00   | 505            |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_7_0.58750   | 12:19:00     | 15:00:00   | 460            |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_11_0.66875  | 15:00:00     | 18:23:00   | 420            |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_5_0.78889   | 18:23:00     | 21:36:35   | 505            |\\n\\nEach of the trips listed here have corresponding entries in\\n`trips.txt` and `stop_times.txt` (more on that shortly). This data\\ncan be interpreted as follows.\\n\\n* The first trip runs every 10m 30s from 5:30am until 7:25am.\\n* The second trip runs every 9m 20s from 7:25am until 8:40am, and so on.\\n\\nThe following table shows some of the stop times for the first trip\\n(`departure_time` is omitted here for brevity, since it is identical\\nto `arrival_time`).\\n\\n| `trip_id`               | `stop_id` | `arrival_time` | `stop_sequence` |\\n| :---------------------- | :-------- | :------------- | :-------------- |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_2_0.26528 | 18        | 06:22:00       | 1               |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_2_0.26528 | 19        | 06:22:59       | 2               |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_2_0.26528 | 20        | 06:24:00       | 3               |\\n| 13S_13S_F1_1_2_0.26528 | 21        | 06:26:00       | 4               |\\n\\nAs this trip runs to the specified frequency, the specific times do not\\nmatter. Instead, the differences are used. For the above stop times,\\nthere is a 59 second gap between the first and second time, a 61 second\\ngap between the second and third, and a 120 second gap between the third\\nand fourth.\\n\\nThe stop times for the first frequency record (10.5 minutes apart) can\\nbe calculated as follows.\\n\\n* `05:30:00`, `05:30:59`, `05:32:00`, `05:34:00`\\n* `05:40:30`, `05:41:29`, `05:42:30`, `05:44:30`\\n* `05:51:00`, `05:51:59`, `05:53:00`, `05:55:00`\\n* ...\\n* `07:25:30`, `07:26:29`, `07:27:30`, `07:29:30`\\n\\n### Specifying Exact Times\\n\\nIn the file definition at the beginning of this chapter there is an\\noptional field called `exact_times`. It may not be immediately clear\\nwhat this field means, so to explain it better, consider the frequency\\ndefinitions in the following table.\\n\\n| `trip_id` | `start_time` | `end_time` | `headway_secs` | `exact_times` |\\n| :-------- | :----------- | :--------- | :------------- | :------------ |\\n| T1        | 09:00:00     | 10:00:00   | 300            | 0             |\\n| T2        | 09:00:00     | 10:00:00   | 300            | 1             |\\n\\nThese two frequencies are the same, with only the `exact_times` value\\ndifferent. The first (`T1`) should be presented in a manner such as:\\n\\n**\"Between 9 AM and 10 AM this trip departs every 5 minutes.\"**\\n\\nThe second trip (`T2`) should be presented as follows:\\n\\n**\"This trip departs at 9 AM, 9:05 AM, 9:10 AM, ...\"**\\n\\nWhile ultimately the meaning is the same, this difference is used in\\norder to allow agencies to represent their schedules more accurately.\\nOften, schedules that convey to passengers that they will not have to\\nwait more than five minutes do so without having to explicitly list\\nevery departure time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 11. Stop Transfers (transfers.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***optional*** in a GTFS feed.*\\n\\nTo define how passengers can transfer between routes at specific stops\\nfeed providers can include `transfers.txt`. This does not mean\\npassengers cannot transfer elsewhere, but it does indicate if a transfer\\nis not possible between certain stops, or a minimum time required if\\ntransfer is possible.\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `from_stop_id` | Required | The ID of stop as it appears in `stops.txt` where the connection begins. If this references a station, then this rule applies to all stops within the station. |\\n| `to_stop_id` | Required | The ID of the stop as it appears in `stops.txt` where the connection between trips ends. If this references a station, then this rule applies to all stops within the station. |\\n| `transfer_type` | Required | `0` or blank means the recommended transfer point, `1` means the secondary vehicle will wait for the first, `2` means a minimum amount of time is required, `3` means transfer is not possible. |\\n| `min_transfer_time` | Optional | If the `transfer_type` value is `2` then this value must be specified. It indicates the number of seconds required to transfer between the given stops. |\\n\\nIt is also possible that records in this file are specified for\\nticketing reasons. For instance, some train stations are set up so that\\npassengers can transfer between routes without needing to validate their\\nticket again or buy a transfer. Other stations that are shared between\\nthose same routes might not have this open transfer area, thereby\\nrequiring you to exit one route fully before buying another ticket to\\naccess the second.\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following table shows some sample transfer rules from TriMet in\\nPortland\\'s GTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `from_stop_id` | `to_stop_id` | `transfer_type` | `min_transfer_time` |\\n| :------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------ |\\n| 7807           | 5020         | 0               |                     |\\n| 7807           | 7634         | 0               |                     |\\n| 7807           | 7640         | 0               |                     |\\n\\nThese rules indicate that if you are transferring from a route that\\nvisits stop `7807` to any route that visits the other stops (`5020`,\\n`7634` or `7640`), then this is the ideal place to do it.\\n\\nIn other words, if there are other locations along the first route where\\nyou could transfer to the second route, then those stops should not be\\nused. These rules say this is the best place to transfer.\\n\\nConsider the transfer rule in the following table, taken from the New\\nYork City Subway GTFS feed (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/mta/79>).\\n\\n| `from_stop_id` | `to_stop_id` | `transfer_type` | `min_transfer_time` |\\n| :------------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :------------------ |\\n| 121            | 121          | 2               | 180                 |\\n\\nIn this data, the MTA specifies how long it takes to transfer to\\ndifferent platforms within the same station. The stop with ID 121 refers\\nto the 86th St station (as specified in `stops.txt`). It has a\\n`location_type` of `1` and two stops within it (`121N` and\\n`121S`). The above transfer rule says that if you need to transfer\\nfrom `121N` to `121S` (or vice-versa) then a minimum time of 3\\nminutes (180 seconds) must be allocated.\\n\\nIf you were to calculate the time taken to transfer using the\\ncoordinates of each of these platforms, it would only take a few seconds\\nas they are physically close to each other. In reality though, you must\\nexit one platform then walk around and enter the other platform (often\\nhaving to use stairs).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 12. Feed Information (feed_info.txt)\\n\\n*This file is ***optional*** in a GTFS feed.*\\n\\nFeed providers can include additional information about a feed using\\n`feed_info.txt`. It should only ever have a single row (other than the\\nCSV header row).\\n\\n| Field  | Required? | Description |\\n| :----- | :-------- | :---------- |\\n| `feed_publisher_name` | Required | The name of the organization that publishes the feed. This may or may not be the same as any agency in `agency.txt`. |\\n| `feed_publisher_url` | Required | The URL of the feed publisher\\'s web site. |\\n| `feed_lang` | Required | This specifies the language used in the feed. If an agency also has a language specified, then the agency\\'s value should override this value. |\\n| `feed_start_date` | Optional | This value is a date in `YYYYMMDD` format that asserts the data in this feed is valid from this date. If specified, it typically matches up with the earliest date in `calendar.txt` or `calendar_dates.txt`, but if it is earlier, this is explicitly saying there are no services running between this date and the earliest service date. |\\n| `feed_end_date` | Optional | This value is a date in `YYYYMMDD` format that asserts the data in this feed is valid until this date. If specified, it typically matches up with the latest date in `calendar.txt` or `calendar_dates.txt`, but if it is earlier, this is explicitly saying there are no services running between the latest service date and this date. |\\n| `feed_version` | Optional | A string that indicates the version of this feed. This can be useful to let feed publishers know whether the latest version of their feed has been incorporated. |\\n\\n### Sample Data\\n\\nThe following sample data is taken from the GTFS feed of TriMet in\\nPortland (<https://openmobilitydata.org/p/trimet>).\\n\\n| `feed_publisher_name` | `feed_publisher_url`                    | `feed_lang` | `feed_start_date` | `feed_end_date` | `feed_version`    |\\n| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- |\\n| TriMet                | [http://trimet.org](http://trimet.org/) | en          |                   |                 | 20140121-20140421 |\\n\\nIn this example, TriMet do not include the start or end dates, meaning\\nyou should derive the dates this feed is active for by the dates in\\n`calendar_dates.txt` (this particular feed does not have a\\n`calendar.txt` file).\\n\\nTriMet use date stamps to indicate the feed version. This feed was\\npublished on 21 January 2014 and includes data up until 21 April 2014,\\nso it appears they use the first/last dates as a way to specify their\\nversion. Each agency has its own method.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 13. Importing a GTFS Feed to SQL\\n\\nOne of the great things about GTFS is that it is already in a format\\nconducive to being used in an SQL database. The presence of various IDs\\nin each of the different files makes it easy to join the tables in order\\nto extract the data you require.\\n\\nTo try this yourself, download `GtfsToSql`\\n(<https://github.com/OpenMobilityData/GtfsToSql>). This is a Java\\ncommand-line application that imports a GTFS feed to an SQLite database.\\nThis application also supports PostgreSQL, but the examples used here\\nare for SQLite.\\n\\nThe pre-compiled `GtfsToSql` Java archive can be downloaded from its\\nGitHub repository at\\n<https://github.com/OpenMobilityData/GtfsToSql/tree/master/dist>.\\n\\nTo use `GtfsToSql`, all you need is an extracted GTFS feed. The\\nfollowing instructions demonstrate how you to import the TriMet feed\\nthat has been referenced throughout this book.\\n\\nFirstly, download and extract the feed. The following commands use curl\\nto download the file, then unzip to extract the file to a sub-directory\\ncalled `trimet`.\\n\\n```\\n$ curl http://developer.trimet.org/schedule/gtfs.zip > gtfs.zip\\n\\n$ unzip gtfs.zip -d trimet/\\n```\\n\\nTo create an SQLite database from this feed, the following command can\\nbe used.\\n\\n```\\n$ java -jar GtfsToSql.jar -s jdbc:sqlite:./db.sqlite -g ./trimet\\n```\\n\\nThis may take a minute or two to complete (you will see progress as it\\nimports the feed and then creates indexes), and at the end you will have\\na GTFS database in a file called `db.sqlite`. You can then query this\\ndatabase with the command-line `sqlite3` tool, as shown in the\\nfollowing example.\\n\\n```\\n$ sqlite3 db.sqlite\\nsqlite> SELECT * FROM agency;\\n|TriMet|http://trimet.org|America/Los_Angeles|en|503-238-7433\\n\\nsqlite> SELECT * FROM routes WHERE route_type = 0;\\n90|||MAX Red Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r090.htm||\\n100|||MAX Blue Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r100.htm||\\n190|||MAX Yellow Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r190.htm||\\n193||Portland Streetcar|NS Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r193.htm||\\n194||Portland Streetcar|CL Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r194.htm||\\n200|||MAX Green Line||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r200.htm||\\n250|||Vintage Trolley||0|http://trimet.org/schedules/r250.htm||\\n```\\n\\nThe first query above finds all agencies stored in the database, while\\nthe second finds all routes marked as Light Rail (`route_type` of\\n`0`).\\n\\n**Note: In the following chapters there are more SQL examples. All of\\nthese examples are geared towards running on an SQLite database that has\\nbeen created in this manner.**\\n\\nAll tables in this database match up with the corresponding GTFS\\nfilename (so for `agency.txt`, the table name is `agency`, while for\\n`stop_times.txt` the table name is `stop_times`). The columns in SQL\\nhave the same name as the value in the corresponding GTFS file.\\n\\n***Note:** All data imported using this tool is stored as text in the\\ndatabase. This means you may need to be careful when querying integer\\ndata. For example, ordering stop times by stop_sequence may not produce\\nexpected results (for instance, 29 as a string comes before 3). Although\\nit is a performance hit, you can change this behavior by casting the\\nvalue to integer, such as: ORDER BY stop_sequence + 0. The reason\\n`GtfsToSql` works in this way is because it is intended as a lightweight\\ntool to be able to quickly query GTFS data. I recommend rolling your own\\nimporter to treat data exactly as you need it, especially in conjunction\\nwith some of the optimization techniques recommended later in this book.*\\n\\n### File Encodings\\n\\nThe GTFS specification does not indicate whether files should be encoded\\nusing UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 or otherwise. Since a GTFS feed is not\\nnecessarily in English, you must be willing to handle an extended\\ncharacter set.\\n\\nThe GtfsToSql tool introduced above automatically detects the encoding\\nof each file using the juniversalchardet Java library\\n(<https://code.google.com/p/juniversalchardet/>).\\n\\nI recommend you take some time looking at the source code of GtfsToSql\\nto further understand this so you are aware of handling encodings\\ncorrectly if you write your own parser.\\n\\n### Optimizing GTFS Feeds\\n\\nIf you are creating a database that is to be distributed onto a mobile\\ndevice such as an iPhone or Android phone, then disk space and\\ncomputational power is at a premium. Even if you are setting up a\\ndatabase to be queried on a server only, then making the database\\nperform as quickly as possible is still important.\\n\\nIn the following chapters are techniques for optimizing GTFS feeds.\\nThere are many techniques that can be applied to improve the performance\\nof GTFS, such as:\\n\\n* Using integer identifiers rather than string identifiers (for route\\n  IDs, trip IDs, stop IDs, etc.) and creating appropriate indexes\\n* Removing redundant shape points and encoding shapes\\n* Deleting unused data\\n* Reusing repeating trip patterns.\\n\\nChanging the data to use integer IDs makes the greatest improvement to\\nperformance, but the other techniques also help significantly.\\n\\nDepending on your needs, there are other optimizations that can be made\\nto reduce file size and speed up querying of the data, but the ease of\\nimplementing them may depend on your database storage system and the\\nprogramming language used to query the data. The above list is a good\\nstarting point.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 14. Switching to Integer IDs\\n\\nThere are a number of instances in a GTFS feed where IDs are used, such\\nas to identify routes, trips, stops and shapes. There are no specific\\nguidelines in GTFS as to the type of data or length an ID can be. As\\nsuch, IDs in some GTFS feeds maybe anywhere up to 30 or 40 characters\\nlong.\\n\\nUsing long strings as IDs is extremely inefficient as they make the size\\nof a database much larger than it needs to be, as well as making\\nquerying the data much slower.\\n\\nTo demonstrate, consider a GTFS feed where trip IDs are 30 characters\\nlong. If there are 10,000 trips, each with an average of 30 stops in\\n`stop_times.txt`, then the IDs alone take up 9.3 MB of storage.\\nRealistically speaking, you need to index the `trip_id` field in order\\nto look up a trip\\'s stop times quickly, which uses even more space.\\n\\nThe following SQL statements show how you might represent GTFS without\\noptimizing the identifiers. For brevity, not all fields from the GTFS\\nfeed are included here.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE trips (\\n  trip_id TEXT,\\n  route_id TEXT,\\n  service_id TEXT\\n);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX trips_trip_id ON trips (trip_id);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX trips_route_id ON trips (route_id);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX trips_service_id ON trips (service_id);\\n\\nCREATE TABLE stop_times (\\n  trip_id TEXT,\\n  stop_id TEXT,\\n  stop_sequence INTEGER\\n);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX stop_times_trip_id ON stop_times (trip_id);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX stop_times_stop_id on stop_times (stop_id);\\n```\\n\\nIf you were to add an integer column to `trips` called, say,\\n`trip_index`, then you can reference that value from `stop_times`\\ninstead of `trip_id`. The following SQL statements show this.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE trips (\\n  trip_id TEXT,\\n  trip_index INTEGER,\\n  route_id TEXT,\\n  service_id TEXT\\n);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX trips_trip_id ON trips (trip_id);\\nCREATE INDEX trips_trip_index ON trips (trip_index);\\nCREATE INDEX trips_route_id ON trips (route_id);\\nCREATE INDEX trips_service_id ON trips (service_id);\\n\\nCREATE TABLE stop_times (\\n  trip_index INTEGER,\\n  stop_id TEXT,\\n  stop_sequence INTEGER\\n);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX stop_times_trip_index ON stop_times (trip_index);\\n\\nCREATE INDEX stop_times_stop_id on stop_times (stop_id);\\n```\\n\\nThis results in a significant space saving (when you consider how large\\n`stop_times` can be), as well as being far quicker to look up stop\\ntimes based on a trip ID. Note that the original `trip_id` value is\\nretained so it can be referenced if required.\\n\\nWithout adding `trip_index`, you would use the following query to find\\nstop times given a trip ID.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM stop_times\\n  WHERE trip_id = \\'SOME_LONG_TRIP_ID\\'\\n  ORDER BY stop_sequence;\\n```\\n\\nWith the addition of `trip_index`, you need to first find the record\\nin `trips`. This can be achieved using the following query. This is a\\nsmall sacrifice compared to performing string comparison on all stop\\ntimes.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM stop_times\\n  WHERE trip_index = (\\n    SELECT trip_index FROM trips WHERE trip_id = \\'SOME_LONG_TRIP_ID\\'\\n  )\\n  ORDER BY stop_sequence;\\n```\\n\\nYou can make the same change for the other IDs in the feed, such as\\n`route_id` and `stop_id`. For these columns you still keep (and\\nindex) the original values in `routes` and `stops` respectively,\\nsince you may still need to look up records based on these values.\\n\\n***Note:** Even though this book recommends optimizing feeds in this\\nmanner, the remainder of examples in this book only use their original\\nIDs, in order to simplify the examples and to ensure compatibility with\\nthe `GtfsToSql` tool introduced previously.*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 15. Optimizing Shapes\\n\\nShape data in a GTFS feed (that is, the records from `shapes.txt`)\\nrepresents a large amount of data. There are a number of ways to reduce\\nthis data, which can help to:\\n\\n* Speed up data retrieval\\n* Reduce the amount of data to transmit to app / web site users\\n* Speed up rendering of the shape onto a map (such as a native mobile\\n  map or a JavaScript map).\\n\\nTwo ways to reduce shape data are as follows:\\n\\n* **Reducing the number of points in a shape.** The shapes included in\\n  GTFS are often very precise and include a number of redundant\\n  points. Many of these can be removed without a noticeable loss of\\n  shape quality using the *Douglas-Peucker Algorithm*.\\n* **Encoding all points in a shape into a single value.** The *Encoded\\n  Polyline Algorithm* used in the Google Maps JavaScript API can also\\n  be used with GTFS shapes. This reduces the amount of storage\\n  required and also makes looking up all points in a shape far\\n  quicker.\\n\\n### Reducing Points in a Shape\\n\\nMany of the shapes you find in GTFS feeds are extremely detailed. They\\noften follow the exact curvature of the road and may consist of hundreds\\nor thousands of points for a trip that might have only 30 or 40 stops.\\n\\nWhile this level of detail is useful, the sheer amount of data required\\nto be rendered on a map can be a massive performance hit from the\\nperspective of retrieving the data as well as rendering on a map.\\nRealistically, shapes do not need this much detail in order to convey\\ntheir message to your users.\\n\\nConsider the following shape from Portland that has been rendered using\\nGoogle Maps. The total shape consists of 1913 points.\\n\\n![Original Shape](images/shape-original.jpg)\\n\\nCompare this now to the same shape that has had redundant points\\nremoved. The total number of points in this shape is 175, which\\nrepresents about a 90% reduction.\\n\\n![Reduced Shape](images/shape-reduced.jpg)\\n\\nIf you look closely, you can see some minor loss of detail, but for the\\nmost part, the shapes are almost identical.\\n\\nThis reduction in points can be achieved using the Douglas-Peucker\\nAlgorithm. It does so by discarding points that do not deviate\\nsignificantly between its surrounding points.\\n\\nThe Douglas-Peucker Algorithm works as follows:\\n\\n* Begin with the first and last points in the path (A and B). These\\n  are always kept.\\n* Find the point between the first and last that is furthest away from\\n  the line joining the first and last line (the orthogonal distance --\\n  see the figure below).\\n* If this point is greater than the allowed distance (the tolerance\\n  level), the point is kept (call it X).\\n* Repeat this algorithm twice: once using A as the first point and X\\n  as the last point, then again using X as the first point and B as\\n  the last point.\\n\\nThis algorithm is recursive, and continues until all points have been\\nchecked.\\n\\n***Note:** The tolerance level determines how aggressively points are\\nremoved. A higher tolerance value is less aggressive and discards less\\ndata, while a lower tolerance discards more data.*\\n\\nThe following diagram shows what orthogonal distance means.\\n\\n![Orthogonal Distance](images/orthogonal-distance.jpg)\\n\\nThe following resources provide more information about the\\nDouglas-Peucker Algorithm and describe how to implement it in your own\\nsystems:\\n\\n* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer-Douglas-Peucker_algorithm>\\n* <http://www.loughrigg.org/rdp/>\\n* <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2573997/reduce-number-of-points-in-line>.\\n\\nYou can often discard about 80-90% of all shape data before seeing a\\nsignificant loss of line detail.\\n\\n### Encoding Shape Points\\n\\nA single entry in `shapes.txt` corresponds to a single point in a\\nsingle shape. Each entry includes a shape ID, a latitude and longitude.\\n\\n***Note:** The `shape_dist_traveled` field is also included, but you do not\\nstrictly need to use this field (nor the corresponding field in\\nstop_times.txt). The technique described in this section will not work\\nif you intend to use `shape_dist_traveled`.*\\n\\nThis means if you want to look up a shape by its ID, you may need to\\nretrieve several hundreds of rows from a database. Using the Encoded\\nPolyline Algorithm you can change your GTFS database so each shape is\\nrepresented by a single row in a database. This means the shape can be\\nfound much more quickly and much less data needs to be processed to\\ndetermine the shape.\\n\\nConsider the following data, taken from TriMet\\'s `shapes.txt` file.\\nThis data represents the first five points of a shape.\\n\\n| `shape_id` | `shape_pt_lat` | `shape_pt_lon` |  `shape_pt_sequence` |  `shape_dist_traveled` |\\n| :--------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------------- | :--------------------- |\\n| `185328`   | `45.52291 `    | `-122.677372`  |  `1`                 |  `0.0`                 |\\n| `185328`   | `45.522921`    | `-122.67737`   |  `2`                 |  `3.7`                 |\\n| `185328`   | `45.522991`    | `-122.677432`  |  `3`                 |  `34.0`                |\\n| `185328`   | `45.522992`    | `-122.677246`  |  `4`                 |  `81.5`                |\\n| `185328`   | `45.523002`    | `-122.676567`  |  `5`                 |  `255.7`               |\\n\\nIf you apply the Encoded Polyline Algorithm to this data, the\\ncoordinates can be represented using the following string.\\n\\n```\\neeztGrlwkVAAML?e@AgC\\n```\\n\\nTo learn how to arrive at this value, you can read up on the Encoded\\nPolyline Algorithm at\\n<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm>.\\n\\nInstead of having every single shape point in a single table, you can\\ncreate a table that has one record per shape. The following SQL\\nstatement is a way you could achieve this.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE shapes (\\n  shape_id TEXT,\\n  encoded_shape TEXT\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThe following table shows how this data could be represented in a\\ndatabase.\\n\\n| `shape_id` | `encoded_shape`        |\\n| :--------- | :--------------------- |\\n| `185328`   | `eeztGrlwkVAAML?e@AgC` |\\n\\nStoring the shape in this manner means you can retrieve an entire shape\\nby looking up only one database row and running it through your decoder.\\n\\nTo further demonstrate how both the encoding and decoding works, try out\\nthe polyline utility at\\n<https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylineutility>.\\n\\nYou can find implementations for encoding and decoding points for\\nvarious languages at the following locations:\\n\\n* <http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/GoogleMaps/EncodePolyline/>\\n* <https://github.com/emcconville/google-map-polyline-encoding-tool>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 16. Deleting Unused Data**\\n\\nOnce you have imported a GTFS feed into a database, it is possible for\\nthere to be a lot of redundant data. This can ultimately slow down any\\nquerying of that data as well as bloating the size of the database. If\\nyou are making an app where the GTFS database is queried on the device\\nthen disk space and computational time are at a premium, so you must do\\nwhat you can to reduce resource usage.\\n\\nThe first thing to check for is expired services. You can do this by\\nsearching `calendar.txt` for entries that expire before today\\'s date.\\nBe aware though, you also need to ensure there are no\\n`calendar_dates.txt` entries overriding these services (a service\\ncould have an `end_date` of, say, `20140110`, but also have a\\n`calendar_dates.txt` entry for `20140131`).\\n\\nFirstly, find service IDs in `calendar_dates.txt` that are still\\nactive using the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates WHERE date >= \\'20140110\\';\\n```\\n\\n***Note:** In order to improve performance of searching for dates, you\\nshould import the date field in `calendar_dates.txt` as an integer, as\\nwell as `start_date` and `end_date` in `calendar.txt`.*\\n\\nAny services matched in this query should not be removed. You can then\\nfind service IDs in `calendar.txt` with the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM calendar WHERE end_date < \\'20140110\\'\\n  AND service_id NOT IN (\\n    SELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates WHERE date >= \\'20140110\\'\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nBefore deleting these services, corresponding trips and stop times must\\nbe removed since you need to know the service ID in order to delete a\\ntrip. Likewise, stop times must be deleted before trips since you need\\nto know the trip IDs to be removed.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM stop_times WHERE trip_id IN (\\n   SELECT trip_id FROM trips WHERE service_id IN (\\n     SELECT service_id FROM calendar WHERE end_date < \\'20140110\\'\\n       AND service_id NOT IN (\\n         SELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates WHERE date >= \\'20140110\\'\\n       )\\n    )\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nNow there may be a series of trips with no stop times. Rather than\\nrepeating the above sub-queries, a more thorough way of removing trips\\nis to remove trips with no stop times.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM trips WHERE trip_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT trip_id FROM stop_times\\n);\\n```\\n\\nWith all `service_id` references removed, you can remove the expired\\nrows from `calendar.txt` using the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM calendar WHERE end_date < \\'20140110\\'\\n  AND service_id NOT IN (\\n    SELECT DISTINCT service_id FROM calendar_dates WHERE date >= \\'20140110\\'\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nThe expired rows in `calendar_dates.txt` can also be removed, which\\ncan be achieved using the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM calendar_dates WHERE date < \\'20140110\\';\\n```\\n\\nThere may now be some stops that are not used by any trips. These can be\\nremoved using the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM stops WHERE stop_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT stop_id FROM stop_times\\n);\\n```\\n\\nAdditionally, you can remove unused shapes and routes using the\\nfollowing queries.\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM shapes WHERE shape_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT shape_id FROM trips\\n);\\n\\nDELETE FROM routes WHERE route_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT route_id FROM trips\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThere are other potential rows that can be removed (such as records in\\n`transfers.txt` that reference non-existent stops), but hopefully you\\nget the idea from the previous queries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 17. Searching for Trips**\\n\\nThis section shows you how to search for trips in a GTFS feed based on\\nspecified times and stops.\\n\\nThe three scenarios covered are:\\n\\n* Finding all stops departing from a given stop after a certain time\\n* Finding all stops arriving at a given stop before a certain time\\n* Finding all trips between two stops after a given time\\n\\nThe first and second scenarios are the simplest, because they only rely\\non a single end of each trip. The third scenario is more complex because\\nyou have to ensure that each trip returned visits both the start and\\nfinish stops.\\n\\nWhen searching for trips, the first thing you need to know is which\\nservices are running for the given search time.\\n\\n### Finding Service IDs\\n\\nThe first step in searching for trips is to determine which services are\\nrunning. To begin with, you need to find service IDs for a given date.\\nYou then need to handle exceptions accordingly. That is, you need to add\\nservice IDs and remove service IDs based on the rules in\\n`calendar_dates.txt`.\\n\\n***Note:** In *Scheduling Past Midnight*, you were shown how\\nGTFS works with times past midnight. The key takeaway from this is that\\nyou have to search for trips for two sets of service IDs. This is\\ncovered as this chapter progresses.*\\n\\nIn Australia, 27 January 2014 (Monday) was the holiday for Australia\\nDay. This is used as an example to demonstrate how to retrieve service\\nIDs.\\n\\nFirstly, you need the main set of service IDs for the day. The following\\nSQL query achieves this.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar\\n  WHERE start_date <= \\'20140127\\' AND end_date >= \\'20140127\\'\\n  AND monday = 1;\\n \\n# Result: 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, 871, 7501\\n```\\n\\nNext you need to find service IDs that are to be excluded, as achieved\\nby the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates\\n  WHERE date = \\'20140127\\' AND exception_type = 2;\\n\\n# Result: 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, 871, 7501\\n```\\n\\nFinally, you need to find service IDs that are to be added. This query\\nis identical to the previous query, except for the different\\n`exception_type` value.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates\\n  WHERE date = \\'20140127\\' AND exception_type = 1;\\n\\n# Result: 12, 874, 4303, 7003\\n```\\n\\nYou can combine these three queries all into a single query in SQLite\\nusing `EXCEPT` and `UNION`, as shown in the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar\\n  WHERE start_date <= \\'20140127\\' AND end_date >= \\'20140127\\'\\n  AND monday = 1\\n  \\nUNION\\n  \\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates\\n  WHERE date = \\'20140127\\' AND exception_type = 1\\n  \\nEXCEPT\\n  \\nSELECT service_id FROM calendar_dates\\n  WHERE date = \\'20140127\\' AND exception_type = 2;\\n\\n# Result: 12, 874, 4304, 7003\\n```\\n\\nNow when you search for trips, only trips that have a matching\\n`service_id` value are included.\\n\\n### Finding Trips Departing a Given Stop\\n\\nIn order to determine the list of services above, a base timestamp on\\nwhich to search is needed. For the purposes of this example, assume that\\ntimestamp is 27 January 2014 at 1 PM (`13:00:00` when using GTFS).\\n\\nThis example searches for all services departing from Adelaide Railway\\nStation, which has stop ID `6665` in the Adelaide Metro GTFS feed. To\\nfind all matching stop times, the following query can be performed.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM stop_times\\n  WHERE stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND departure_time >= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND pickup_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nThis returns a series of stop times that match the given criteria. The\\nonly problem is it does not yet take into account valid service IDs.\\n\\n***Note:** This query may also return stop times that are the final stop\\non a trip, which is not useful for somebody trying to find departures.\\nYou may want to modify your database importer to override the final stop\\ntime of each trip so its `pickup_type` has a value of `1` (no pick-up) and\\nits first stop time so it has a `drop_off_type` of `1` (no drop-off).*\\n\\nTo make sure only the correct trips are returned, join `stop_times`\\nwith `trips` using `trip_id`, and then include the list of service\\nIDs. For the purposes of this example the service IDs, stop ID and\\ndeparture time are being hard-coded. You can either embed a sub-query,\\nor include the service IDs via code.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'12\\', \\'874\\', \\'4304\\', \\'7003\\')\\n  AND st.departure_time >= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st.pickup_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nThis gives you the final list of stop times matching the desired\\ncriteria. You can then decide specifically which data you need to\\nretrieve; you now have the `trip_id`, meaning you can find all stop\\ntimes for a given trip if required.\\n\\nIf you need to restrict the results to only those that occur after the\\nstarting stop, you can retrieve stop times with only a `stop_sequence`\\nlarger than that of the stop time returned in the above query.\\n\\n### Finding Trips Arriving at a Given Stop\\n\\nIn order to find the trips arriving at a given stop before a specified\\ntime, it is just a matter of making slight modifications to the above\\nquery. Firstly, check the `arrival_time` instead of\\n`departure_time`. Also, check the `drop_off_type` value instead of\\n`pickup_type`.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'12\\', \\'874\\', \\'4304\\', \\'7003\\')\\n  AND st.arrival_time <= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st.drop_off_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.arrival_time DESC;\\n```\\n\\nFor this particular data set, there are trips from four different routes\\nreturned. If you want to restrict this to a particular route, you can\\nfilter on the `t.route_id` value.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'12\\', \\'874\\', \\'4304\\', \\'7003\\')\\n  AND t.route_id = \\'BEL\\'\\n  AND st.arrival_time <= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st.drop_off_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.arrival_time DESC;\\n```\\n\\n### Performance of Searching Text-Based Times\\n\\nThese examples search using text-based arrival/departure times (such as\\n`13:00:00`). This works because the GTFS specification mandates that\\nall times are `HH:MM:SS` format (although `H:MM:SS` is allowed for times\\nearlier than 10 AM).\\n\\nDoing this kind of comparison (especially if you are scanning millions\\nof rows) is quite slow and expensive. It is more efficient to convert\\nall times stored in the database to integers that represent the number\\nof seconds since midnight.\\n\\n***Note:** The GTFS specification states that arrival and departure times\\nare \"noon minus 12 hours\" in order to account for daylight savings time.\\nThis is effectively midnight, except for the days that daylight savings\\nstarts or finishes.*\\n\\nIn order to achieve this, you can convert the text-based time to an\\ninteger with `H * 3600 + M * 60 + S`. For example, `13:35:21` can\\nbe converted using the following steps.\\n\\n```\\n  (13 * 3600) + (35 * 60) + (21)\\n= 46800 + 2100 + 21\\n= 48921\\n```\\n\\nYou can then convert back to hours, minutes and seconds in order to\\ngenerate timestamps in your application as shown in the following\\nalgorithm.\\n\\n```\\nH = floor( 48921 / 3600 )\\n  = floor( 13.59 )\\n  = 13\\n  \\nM = floor( 48921 / 60 ) % 60\\n  = floor( 815.35 ) % 60\\n  = 815 % 60\\n  = 35\\n  \\nS = 48921 % 60\\n  = 21\\n```\\n\\n### Finding Trips Between Two Stops\\n\\nNow that you know how to look up a trip from or to a given stop, the\\nprevious query can be expanded so both the start and finish stop are\\nspecified. The following example finds trips that depart after 1 PM. The\\nsearch only returns trips departing from *Adelaide Railway Station*\\n(stop ID `6665`) are shown. Additionally, only trips that then visit\\n*Blackwood Railway Station* (stop IDs `6670` and `101484`) are\\nincluded.\\n\\nIn order to achieve this, the following changes must be made to the\\nprevious examples.\\n\\n* **Join against stop_times twice.** Once for the departure stop time\\n  and once for the arrival stop time.\\n* **Allow for multiple stop IDs at one end.** The destination in this\\n  example has two platforms, so you need to check both of them.\\n* **Ensure the departure time is earlier than the arrival time.\\n  **Otherwise trips heading in the opposite direction may also be\\n  returned.\\n\\nThe following query demonstrates how this is achieved.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st1.*, st2.*\\n  FROM trips t, stop_times st1, stop_times st2\\n  WHERE st1.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND st2.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND st1.stop_id = \\'6665\\'\\n  AND st2.stop_id IN (\\'6670\\', \\'101484\\')\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'12\\', \\'874\\', \\'4304\\', \\'7003\\')\\n  AND st1.departure_time >= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st1.pickup_type = 0\\n  AND st2.drop_off_type = 0\\n  AND st1.departure_time < st2.arrival_time\\n  ORDER BY st1.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the table alias `st1` is used for the departure stop\\ntime. Once again, the stop ID must match, as well as the departure time\\nand pick-up type.\\n\\nFor the arrival stop time the alias `st2` is used. This table also\\njoins the `trips` table using `trip_id`. Since the destination has\\nmultiple stop IDs, the SQL `IN` construct is used. The arrival time is\\nnot important in this example, so only the departure is checked.\\n\\nThe final thing to check is that the departure occurs before the\\narrival. If you do not perform this step, then trips traveling in the\\nopposite direction may also be returned.\\n\\n***Note:** Technically, there may be multiple results returned for the\\nsame trip. For some transit agencies, a single trip may visit the a stop\\nmore than once. If this is the case, you should also check the trip\\nduration (arrival time minus departure time) and use the shortest trip\\nwhen the same trip is returned multiple times.*\\n\\n### Accounting for Midnight\\n\\nAs discussed previously, GTFS has the ability for the trips to depart or\\narrive after midnight for a given service day without having to specify\\nit as part of the next service day. Consequently, while the queries\\nabove are correct, they do not necessarily paint the full picture.\\n\\nIn reality, when performing a trip search, you need to take into account\\ntrips that have wrapped times (for instance, where 12:30 AM is specified\\nas `24:30:00`). If you want to find trips that depart after 12:30 AM\\non a given day, you need to check for trips departing after\\n`00:30:00` on that day, as well as for trips departing at\\n`24:30:00` on the previous day.\\n\\nThis means that for each trip search you are left with two sets of\\ntrips, which you must then merge and present as appropriate.\\n\\n***Note:** In reality, agencies generally do not have trips that overlap\\nfrom multiple service days, so technically you often only need one query\\n(for example, a train service might end on 12:30 AM then restart on the\\nnext service day at 4:30 AM). If your app / web site only uses a single\\nfeed where you can tune your queries manually based on how the agency\\noperates, then you can get away with only querying a single service day.\\nOn the other hand, if you are building a scalable system that works with\\ndata from many agencies, then you need to check both days.*\\n\\nTo demonstrate how this works in practice, the following example\\nsearches for all trips that depart after 12:30:00 AM on 14 March 2014.\\nThe examples earlier in this chapter showed how to find the service IDs\\nfor a given date. To account for midnight, service IDs for both March 14\\n(the \"main\" service date) and March 13 (the overlapping date) need to be\\ndetermined.\\n\\nAssume that March 13 has a service ID of `C1` and March 14 has a\\nservice ID of `C2`. First you need to find the departures for March\\n14, as shown in the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'S1\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'C1\\')\\n  AND st.departure_time >= \\'00:30:00\\'\\n  AND st.pickup_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nThe resultant list needs to be combined with the trips that depart after\\nmidnight from the March 13 service. To check this, it is just a matter\\nof swapping in the right service IDs, then adding 24 hours to the search\\ntime.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.*, st.* FROM stop_times st, trips t\\n  WHERE st.stop_id = \\'S1\\'\\n  AND st.trip_id = t.trip_id\\n  AND t.service_id IN (\\'C2\\')\\n  AND st.departure_time >= \\'24:30:00\\'\\n  AND st.pickup_type = 0\\n  ORDER BY st.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nIn order to get your final list of trips you must combine the results\\nfrom both of these queries. If you are generating complete timestamps in\\norder to present the options to your users, just remember to account for\\nthe results from the second query being 24 hours later.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 18. Working With Trip Blocks**\\n\\nOne of the more complex aspects of GTFS is how to properly use the\\n`block_id` field in `trips.txt`. The concept is simple, but\\nincorporating this information in a manner that is simple to understand\\nfor a passenger can be more difficult.\\n\\nA single vehicle (such as a bus or train) completes multiple trips in a\\nsingle service day. For instance, once a bus completes its trip (Trip X)\\nfrom Location A to Location B, it then begins another trip (Trip Y) from\\nLocation B to Location C. It then completes a final trip (Trip Z) from\\nLocation C back to Location A.\\n\\nIf a passenger boards in the middle of Trip X and is allowed to stay on\\nthe bus until the end of the Trip Y, then this should be represented in\\nGTFS by giving Trips X, Y, Z the same `block_id` value.\\n\\nThe following diagram shows a vehicle that performs two trips,\\ncompleting opposite directions of the same route. Often a single vehicle\\nwill do many more than just two trips in a day.\\n\\n![Block](images/block-01.png)\\n\\n***Note:** When trips in a block are represented in stop_times.txt, the\\nfinal stop of a trip and the first stop of the subsequent trip must both\\nbe included, even though they are typically at the same stop (and often\\nthe same arrival & departure time). The final stop of the first trip is\\ndrop-off only, while the first stop of the next trip is pick-up only.*\\n\\nIn the following diagram, the vehicle completes three trips, each for\\nseparate routes. As in the previous diagram, the vehicle will likely\\ncomplete more trips over a single day.\\n\\n![Block](images/block-02.png)\\n\\nThese two diagrams show the difficulties that can arise when trying to\\ncalculate trips across multiple blocks. The first diagram is repeated\\nbelow, this time with stops marked so trips between two locations can be\\nfound.\\n\\n![Block](images/block-03.png)\\n\\nConsider the scenario where you want to retrieve all trip times from\\nStop S2 to Stop S1. Since the vehicle gets to Stop S3 then turns around\\nand heads back to S1, the trip search returns two options:\\n\\n1. Board at S2 on the upper trip, travel via S3, then get to S1.\\n2. Board at S2 on the lower trip, travel directly to S1.\\n\\nThe second option is a subset of the first option, which means it is a\\nfar shorter trip (plus it avoids the passenger getting annoyed from\\npassing their starting point again). To determine which option to use,\\nyou can use the trip duration.\\n\\nNow consider the other type of block formation, where a vehicle\\ncompletes subsequent trips from different routes.\\n\\n![Block](images/block-04.png)\\n\\nIf a passenger wants to travel from Stop S2 to S4, you will not get the\\nsituation where the vehicle travels past the same location twice.\\nHowever, it is also possible for a passenger to travel from Stop S2 to\\nStop S6 without ever having to change vehicles.\\n\\nReferring back to the previous chapter about performing trip searches,\\nit is relatively straightforward to account for blocks in these\\nsearches. Using the query to find trips between two stops as a\\nreference, the following changes need to be made:\\n\\n* Instead of joining both occurrences of `stop_times` to the\\n  `trips` table, you now need two occurrences of `trips`.\\n* Each `stop_times` table occurrence is joined to a separate\\n  `trips` table occurrence.\\n* The two occurrences of `trips` are joined on the `block_id`\\n  value (if it is available).\\n\\nThe following query shows how to find trips that start at stop `S2`\\nand finish at stop `S4`, departing after 1 PM on the day with service\\nID `C1`.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t1.*, t2.*, st1.*, st2.*\\n  FROM trips t1, trips t2, stop_times st1, stop_times st2\\n  WHERE st1.trip_id = t1.trip_id\\n  AND st2.trip_id = t2.trip_id\\n  AND st1.stop_id = \\'S2\\'\\n  AND st2.stop_id = \\'S4\\'\\n  AND t1.service_id = \\'C1\\'\\n  AND (\\n    t1.trip_id = t2.trip_id\\n    OR (\\n      LENGTH(t1.block_id) > 0 AND t1.block_id = t2.block_id\\n    )\\n  )\\n  AND st1.departure_time >= \\'13:00:00\\'\\n  AND st1.pickup_type = 0\\n  AND st2.drop_off_type = 0\\n  AND st1.departure_time < st2.arrival_time\\n  ORDER BY st1.departure_time;\\n```\\n\\nSince `block_id` may be unpopulated, the query joins on both the\\n`trip_id` and the `block_id`.\\n\\n***Note:** An alternative is to guarantee every single trip has a\\n`block_id` value when importing -- even if some blocks only consist of\\na single trip. If you can guarantee this condition, then you can\\nsimplify this query by using `t1.block_id = t2.block_id`.*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 19. Calculating Fares**\\n\\nIn order to calculate a fare for a trip in GTFS, you must use data from\\n`fare_attributes.txt` and `fare_rules.txt`. It is relatively\\nstraightforward to calculate the cost of a single trip (that is,\\nboarding a vehicle, traveling for a number of stops, then disembarking),\\nbut it becomes much more complicated when you need to take into account\\nmultiple trip segments (that is, one or more transfers).\\n\\n***Note:** As it stands, many feed providers do not include fare\\ninformation. This is because many systems have a unique set of rules\\nthat cannot be modelled with the current structure of fares in GTFS.\\nAdditionally, it is not possible to determine different classes of\\npricing (such as having a separate price for adults and children). For\\nthe purposes of this chapter, these limitations are ignored.*\\n\\nFor more discussion on how fares work in GTFS, refer to *Fare\\nDefinitions (`fare_attributes.txt` & `fare_rules.txt`)*.\\n\\nThis chapter first shows you how to calculate fares for a single trip,\\nthen how to account for transfers and for multiple trips.\\n\\n### Calculating a Single Trip Fare\\n\\nMuch of the logic used when calculating fares requires knowledge of the\\nzones used in a trip.\\n\\n***Note:** A zone is a physical area within a transit system that\\ncontains a series of stops. They are used to group trip pricing into key\\nareas in a system. Some transit systems do not work like this (for\\ninstance, they may measure the physical distance travelled rather than\\nspecific stops), which is one reason why the GTFS fares model does not\\nwork in all cases.*\\n\\nA zone is defined in GTFS by the `zone_id` column in `stops.txt`. A\\nsingle stop can only belong to one zone.\\n\\nFares are matched to a trip using a combination of any of the following:\\n\\n* The route of the trip\\n* The zone of the stop the passenger boards from\\n* The zone of the stop the passenger disembarks\\n* The zone(s) of any stops on the trip that are passed while the\\n  passenger is on board.\\n\\nConsider the following simplified data set that may appear in\\n`stops.txt` and `stop_times.txt`. Assume for this example that the\\ntrip `T1` belongs to a route with an ID of `R1`.\\n\\n```\\nstop_id,zone_id\\nS1,Z1\\nS2,Z1\\nS3,Z2\\nS4,Z3\\n\\ntrip_id,stop_id,stop_sequence\\nT1,S1,1\\nT1,S2,2\\nT1,S3,3\\nT1,S4,4\\n```\\n\\nIf a passenger travels from stop S1 to stop S4, then their starting zone\\nis Z1, their finishing zone is Z3, and the zones they pass through are\\nZ1, Z2 and Z3.\\n\\n***Note:** When calculating fares, the start and finish zones are also\\nincluded in the zones passed through, so in this example you Z3 is also\\nconsidered as a zone that the trip passes through.*\\n\\nUsing this data, you can now calculate matching fares. To do so, you\\nneed to find all fares that match either of the following:\\n\\n* Fares that have no associated rules.\\n* Fares that have rules that match the specified trip. If a fare\\n  defines multiple zones that must be passed through (using\\n  `contains_id`), then all zones must be matched.\\n\\nIf multiple fares qualify for a trip, then the cheapest fare is the one\\nto use.\\n\\n### Finding Fares With No Rules\\n\\nThis is the simplest use-case for fares. You can find all matching fares\\nwith the following SQL.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM fare_attributes WHERE fare_id NOT IN (\\n  SELECT DISTINCT fare_id FROM fare_rules\\n);\\n```\\n\\nIf a feed only has `fare_attributes.txt` records with no rules, then\\nthe difference between the fares is in the transfer rules. This section\\nonly covers calculating fares for a single trip with no transfers, so\\nfor now you can just select the cheapest fare using the following SQL.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM fare_attributes WHERE fare_id NOT IN (\\n    SELECT DISTINCT fare_id FROM fare_rules\\n  )\\n  ORDER BY price + 0 LIMIT 1;\\n```\\n\\n***Note:** You still need to check for fares with one or more rules in\\norder to find the cheapest price. Also, `0` is added in this query in\\norder to cast a string to a number. When you roll your own importer you\\nshould instead import this as a numerical value.*\\n\\n### Finding Fares With Matched Rules\\n\\nNext you must check against specific rules for a fare. In order to do\\nthis, you need the starting zone, finishing zone, and all zones passed\\nthrough (including the start and finish zones).\\n\\nReferring back to the previous example, if a trip starts at `Z1`,\\npasses through `Z2` and finishes at `Z3`, you can find fare\\ncandidates (that is, trips that *may* match), using the following SQL\\nquery.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM fare_attributes WHERE fare_id IN (\\n    SELECT fare_id FROM fare_rules\\n      WHERE (LENGTH(route_id) = 0 OR route_id = \\'R1\\')\\n      AND (LENGTH(origin_id) = 0 OR origin_id = \\'Z1\\')\\n      AND (LENGTH(destination_id) = 0 OR destination_id = \\'Z3\\')\\n      AND (LENGTH(contains_id) = 0 OR contains_id IN (\\'Z1\\', \\'Z2\\', \\'Z3\\')\\n    )\\n  );\\n```\\n\\nThis returns a list of fares that may qualify for the given trip. As\\nsome fares have multiple rules, all must be checked. The algorithm to\\nrepresent this is as follows.\\n\\n```\\nfares = [ result from above query ]\\n\\nqualifyingFares = [ ]\\n\\nfor (fare in fares) {\\n  if (qualifies(fare))\\n    qualifyingFares.add(fare)\\n}\\n\\nallFares = qualifyFares + faresWithNoRules\\n\\npassengerFare = cheapest(allFares)\\n```\\n\\nAs shown on the final two lines, once you have the list of qualifying\\nfares, you can combine these with fares that have no rules (from the\\nprevious section) and then determine the cheapest fare.\\n\\nFirst though, you must determine if a fare with rules qualifies for the\\ngiven trip. If a fare specifies zones that must be passed through, then\\nall rules must be matched.\\n\\n***Note:** If a particular rule specifies a different route, start, or\\nfinish than the one you are checking, you do not need to ensure the\\n`contains_id` matches, since this rule no longer applies. You still need\\nto check the other rules for this fare.*\\n\\nThe algorithm needs to build up a list of zone IDs from the fare rules\\nin order to check against the trip. Once this has been done, you need to\\ncheck that every zone ID collected from the rules is contained in the\\ntrip\\'s list of zones.\\n\\n```\\nqualifies(fare, routeId, originId, destinationId, containsIds) {\\n\\n  fareContains = [ ]\\n  \\n  for (rule in fare.rules) {\\n    if (rule.contains.length == 0)\\n      continue\\n      \\n    if (rule.route.length > 0 AND rule.route != routeId)\\n      continue\\n      \\n    if (rule.origin.length > 0 AND rule.origin != originId)\\n      continue\\n      \\n    if (rule.desination.length > 0 AND rule.destination != destinationId)\\n      continue\\n      \\n    fareContains.add(rule.containsId);\\n }\\n \\n if (fareContains.size == 0)\\n   return YES\\n   \\n if (containIds HAS EVERY ELEMENT IN fareContains)\\n   return YES\\n else \\n   return NO\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis algorithm achieves the following:\\n\\n* Only rules that have a value for `contains_id` are relevant. Rules\\n  that do not have this value fall through and should be considered as\\n  qualified.\\n* If the route is specified but not equal to the one being checked, it\\n  is safe to ignore the rule\\'s `contains_id`. If the route is empty\\n  or equal, the loop iteration can continue.\\n* Check for the `origin_id` and `destination_id` in the same\\n  manner as `route_id`.\\n* If the route, origin and destination all qualify then store the\\n  `contains_id` so it can be checked after the loop.\\n\\nThe algorithm returns *yes* if the fare qualifies, meaning you can save\\nit as a qualifying fare. You can then return the cheapest qualifying\\nfare to the user.\\n\\n### Calculating Trips With Transfers\\n\\nOnce you introduce transfers, fare calculation becomes more complicated.\\nA \"trip with a transfer\" is considered to be a trip where the passenger\\nboards a vehicle, disembarks, and then gets on another vehicle. For\\nexample:\\n\\n* Travel on trip T1 from Stop S1 to Stop S2\\n* Walk from Stop S2 to Stop S3\\n* Travel on trip T2 from Stop S3 to Stop S4.\\n\\nIn order to calculate the total fare for a trip with transfers, the\\nfollowing algorithm is used:\\n\\n1. Retrieve list of qualifying fares for each trip individually\\n2. Create a list of every fare combination possible\\n3. Loop over all combinations and find the total cost\\n4. Return the lowest cost from Step 3.\\n\\nStep 1 was covered in *Calculating a Single Trip Fare*, but\\nyou must skip the final step of finding the cheapest fare. This is\\nbecause the cheapest fare may change depending on subsequent transfers.\\nInstead, this step is performed once the cheapest *combination* is\\ndetermined.\\n\\nTo demonstrate Step 2, consider the following example:\\n\\n* The trip on T1 from S1 to S2 yields the following qualifying fares:\\n  F1, F2.\\n* The subsequent trip on T2 from S3 to S4 yields the following\\n  qualifying fares: F3, F4.\\n\\nGenerating every combination of these fares yields the following\\npossibilities:\\n\\n* F1 + F3\\n* F1 + F4\\n* F2 + F3\\n* F2 + F4.\\n\\nStep 3 can now be performed, which involves finding the total cost for\\neach combinations. As you need to take into account the possibility of\\ntimed transfers (according to the data stored in\\n`fare_attributes.txt`), you also need to know about the times of these\\ntrips.\\n\\nThe following algorithm can be used to calculate the total cost using\\ntransfer rules. In this example, you would call this function once for\\neach fare combination.\\n\\n```\\nfunction totalCost(fares) {\\n  total = 0\\n \\n  for (fare in fares) {\\n    freeTransfer = NO\\n \\n    if (previousFare ALLOWS TRANSFERS) {\\n      if (HAS ENOUGH TRANSFERS REMAINING) {\\n        if (TRANSFER NOT EXPIRED) {\\n          freeTransfer = YES\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n \\n    if (!freeTransfer)\\n      total = total + fare.price;\\n     \\n    previousFare = fare;\\n  }\\n \\n  return total;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOnce all combinations have called the `totalCost` algorithm, you will\\nhave a price for each trip. You can then return the lowest price as the\\nfinal price for the trip.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 20. Trip Patterns**\\n\\nIn a GTFS feed, a route typically has multiple trips that start and\\nfinish at the same stops. If you are looking to reduce the size of the\\ndata stored, then converting data from `stop_times.txt` into a series\\nof reusable patterns is an excellent way to do so.\\n\\nFor two trips to share a common pattern, the following must hold true:\\n\\n* The stops visited and the order in which they are visited must be the same\\n* The time differences between each stop must be the same.\\n\\nThe following table shows some fictional trips to demonstrate this.\\n\\n| **Stop** | **Trip 1** | **Trip 2** | **Trip 3** |\\n| :------- | :--------- | :--------- | :--------- |\\n| S1       | 10:00:00   | 10:10:00   | 10:20:00   |\\n| S2       | 10:02:00   | 10:13:00   | 10:22:00   |\\n| S3       | 10:05:00   | 10:15:00   | 10:25:00   |\\n| S4       | 10:06:00   | 10:18:00   | 10:26:00   |\\n| S5       | 10:10:00   | 10:21:00   | 10:30:00   |\\n\\nIn a GTFS feed, this would correspond to 15 records in\\n`stop_times.txt`. If you look more closely though, you can see the\\ntrips are very similar. The following table shows the differences\\nbetween each stop time, instead of the actual time.\\n\\n| **Stop** | **Trip 1**      | **Trip 2**      | **Trip 3**      |\\n| :------- | :-------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- |\\n| S1       | 00:00:00        | 00:00:00        | 00:00:00        |\\n| S2       | 00:02:00 (+2m)  | 00:03:00 (+3m)  | 00:02:00 (+2m)  |\\n| S3       | 00:05:00 (+5m)  | 00:05:00 (+5m)  | 00:05:00 (+5m)  |\\n| S4       | 00:06:00 (+6m)  | 00:08:00 (+8m)  | 00:06:00 (+6m)  |\\n| S5       | 00:10:00 (+10m) | 00:11:00 (+11m) | 00:10:00 (+10m) |\\n\\nYou can see from this table that the first and third trip, although they\\nstart at different times, have the same offsets between stops (as well\\nas stopping at identical stops).\\n\\nInstead of using a table to store stop times, you can store patterns. By\\nstoring the ID of the pattern with each trip, you can reduce the list of\\nstop times in this example from 15 to 10. As only time offsets are\\nstored for each patterns, the trip starting time also needs to be saved\\nwith each trip.\\n\\nYou could use SQL such as the following to model this.\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE trips (\\n  trip_id TEXT,\\n  pattern_id INTEGER,\\n  start_time TEXT,\\n  start_time_secs INTEGER\\n);\\n\\nCREATE TABLE patterns (\\n  pattern_id INTEGER,\\n  stop_id TEXT,\\n  time_offset INTEGER,\\n  stop_sequence INTEGER\\n);\\n```\\n\\nThe data you would store for trips in this example is shown in the\\nfollowing table.\\n\\n| `trip_id` | `pattern_id` | `start_time` | `start_time_secs` |\\n| :-------- | :----------- | :----------- | :---------------- |\\n| T1        | 1            | 10:00:00     | 36000             |\\n| T2        | 2            | 10:10:00     | 36600             |\\n| T3        | 1            | 10:20:00     | 37200             |\\n\\n***Note:** The above table includes start_time_secs, which is an integer\\nvalue representing the number of seconds since the day started. Using\\nthe hour, minutes and seconds in start_time, this value is `H * 3600 + M * 60 + S`.*\\n\\nIn the `patterns` table, you would store data as in the following\\ntable.\\n\\n| `pattern_id` | `stop_id` | `time_offset` | `stop_sequence` |\\n| :----------- | :-------- | :------------ | :-------------- |\\n| 1            | S1        | 0             | 1               |\\n| 1            | S2        | 120           | 2               |\\n| 1            | S3        | 300           | 3               |\\n| 1            | S4        | 360           | 4               |\\n| 1            | S5        | 600           | 5               |\\n| 2            | S1        | 0             | 1               |\\n| 2            | S2        | 180           | 2               |\\n| 2            | S4        | 300           | 3               |\\n| 2            | S5        | 480           | 4               |\\n| 2            | S6        | 660           | 5               |\\n\\nAs you can see, this represents an easy way to significantly reduce the\\namount of data stored. You could have tens or hundreds of trips each\\nsharing the same pattern. When you scale this to the entire feed, this\\ncould reduce, say, 3 million records to about 200,000.\\n\\n***Note:** This is a somewhat simplified example, as there is other data\\navailable in `stop_times.txt` (such as separate arrival/departure times,\\ndrop-off type and pick-up type). You should take all of this data into\\naccount when determining how to allocate patterns.*\\n\\n### Updating Trip Searches\\n\\nChanging your model to reuse patterns instead of storing every stop time\\nmeans your data lookup routines must also be changed.\\n\\nFor example, to find all stop times for a given trip, you must now find\\nthe pattern using the following SQL query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM patterns\\n  WHERE pattern_id = (SELECT pattern_id FROM trips WHERE trip_id = \\'YOUR_TRIP_ID\\')\\n  ORDER BY stop_sequence;\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to determine the arrival/departure time, you must add the\\noffset stored for the pattern record to the starting time stored with\\nthe trip. This involves joining the tables and adding `time_offset` to\\n`start_time_secs`, as shown in the following query.\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT t.start_time_secs + p.time_offset, p.stop_id\\n  FROM patterns p, trips t\\n  WHERE p.pattern_id = t.pattern_id\\n  AND t.trip_id = \\'YOUR_TRIP_ID\\'\\n  ORDER BY p.stop_sequence;\\n```\\n\\n### Other Data Reduction Methods\\n\\nThere are other ways you can reduce the amount of data, such as only\\nusing patterns to store the stops (and not timing offsets), and then\\nstoring the timings with each trip record. A technique such as this\\nfurther reduces the size of the database, but the trade-off is that\\nquerying the data becomes slightly more complex.\\n\\nHopefully you can see that by using the method described in this chapter\\nthere are a number of ways to be creative with GTFS data, and that you\\nmust make decisions when it comes to speed, size, and ease of querying\\ndata.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThanks for reading *The Definitive Guide to GTFS*. While there are many\\ntechniques that may take some time to comprehend in this book, the\\ncontent should bring you up to speed with GTFS quickly.\\n\\nAt first glance, GTFS appears to be very simple, but there are a number\\nof \"gotchas\" which are not immediately apparent until you have spent\\nsignificant time working with a range of feeds.\\n\\nThe key takeaways from this book are:\\n\\n* How GTFS feeds are structured\\n* How to import a GTFS feed to SQL and perform queries\\n* How to search for trips, handle blocks and calculate fares\\n* How to optimize an SQL database to minimize resource usage on mobile\\n  devices.\\n\\nIf you have enjoyed this book, please share it or feel free to contribution improvements or changes as necessary.\\n\\n*Quentin Zervaas*\\nFebruary, 2014\\n\\n'"
